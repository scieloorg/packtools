    Constructs an XML 'back' element and populates it with child elements.

    This function takes a list of lists, where each sublist contains XML elements,
    and appends all these elements as children of a newly created 'back' element.

    Args:
        nodes (list of list of xml.etree.ElementTree.Element):
            A list of lists containing 'Element' objects to be added as children of the 'back' element.

        nodes = [
