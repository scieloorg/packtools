<h3 class="articleSectionTitle">ABSTRACT</h3>
<p>The exercise of analysis of performance dance discourse is carried out grounded
                    in Bakhtin’s concept of chronotope. On the basis of the classical ballet genre,
                    theater is established as a constitutive chronotope that materializes its
                    social-aesthetic values spatial-temporally. The analysis of chronotopic
                    transgressions allows identifying the emergence of modern ballet based on two
                    choreographies by Russian artist Vaslav Nijinski.</p>

<h3 class="articleSectionTitle">Introduction</h3>
<p>This article aims to continue a previously published study whose analysis of
                    dance was conducted with the assistance of the concept of discourse genre
                    discussed by Bakhtin and the Circle. The same methodological approach will be
                    adopted here, as we will focus, in the multisemiotic discourse of dance, on the
                    choreographic dimension. In the previous study we were able to establish typical
                    utterances of different genres, such as romantic classical ballet and hip-hop.
                    We could thus identify the social-aesthetic values of each discourse (<span class="ref"><span class="xref xrefblue"><a href="#B1_ref" data-ref="AMORIM, M. O discurso da dança e o conceito de gênero – alguns

<p>The result of this approach is a partial analysis that does not intend to cover
                    dance in its global-aesthetic condition,<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn28_ref" name="xref_fn28" data-ref="1 
    As an example of an approach that contemplates multiple languages related to
                        the discourse of dance, see Irene Machado’s excellent article, whose
                        reference is on the Reference list at the end of this paper.">1</a></sup></span>
                    a totality that is woven by several languages. We have chosen to call it an
                    exercise of analysis as we aim to allow it not only to deepen our understanding
                    of the production of meaning from a specific <i>corpus</i>, but also
                    to concretely practice using one or more concepts of the theories we have
                    adopted so as to confront their limitations and possibilities. Therefore, this
                    exercise should bring theoretical contributions whether by specifying and
                    deepening the concepts used or by broadening their scope of validity.</p>
<p>Focusing on the discourse of dance as an object of research entails accepting its
                    verbal-visual nature. Although permeated by verbal components, such as the
                    titles of the performances, which actively participate in the entire production
                    of meaning, its visual component is undoubtedly predominant. On this material
                    component, Grillo states that “(…) language is founded on an indexical matrix
                    that includes either an iconic relationship or a relationship of resemblance
                    with referents of the world” (<span class="ref"><span class="xref xrefblue"><a href="#B7_ref" data-ref="GRILLO, S. V. C. Fundamentos bakhtinianos para a análise de

    Unless otherwise indicated, the translation of quotations from Portuguese
                        into English is ours. In the original: “[...] a linguagem visual funda-se
                        sobre uma matriz indicial que comporta uma relação icônica ou de semelhança
                        com os referentes do mundo.”">2</a></sup></span></p>
<p>However, as we advance in the history of dance, we learn that, apart from the
                    pantomime of the first classical ballets, the iconic dimension of visual
                    discourse becomes more complex. In fact, if it is not inscribed in a universe of
                    genres that hold their own values, it becomes more difficult to read and analyze
                    the discursiveness of dance choreography. <i>Complex iconicity</i> is
                    the term we have chosen to name this form of meaning relation with which the
                    visual discourse of dance operates. Thus, in our previous study, as we
                    identified the recurrent forms of different dance discourse genres, we
                    demonstrated that the utterances of each genre affirm and embody specific social
                    and aesthetic values that inform and conform the iconicity of choreographic
                    movements.</p>
<h3 class="articleSectionTitle">1 The Concept of Chronotope</h3>
<p>The complex iconicity of choreographic discourse requires that we use another
                    Bakhtinian concept, that is, the concept of chronotope. This is due to that fact
                    that Bakhtin himself points to the importance of discussing the chronotope of
                    the genre when the concept was first formulated.</p>
<p>For Bakhtin, the term chronotope, which is borrowed from biology and physics,
                    defines certain conditions of inseparability between time and space within a
                    narrative. In the literary analysis he carries out, space is marked by temporal
                    indices and time is only embodied in that space; thus, a particular space-time
                    corresponds to a specific discourse genre. For example, as Bakhtin analyzes
                    Flaubert’s <i>Madame Bovary</i>, he shows the <i>form</i> of
                    time as he confers to it a material density:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>Such towns are the locus for cyclical everyday time. (…) Time here has no
                        advancing historical movement; it moves rather in narrow circles: the circle
                        of the day, of the week, of the month, of a person’s entire life. A day is
                        just a day, a year is just a year – a life is just a life. Day in, day out
                        the same round of activities are repeated, the same topics of conversation,
                        the same words and so forth (…) This is commonplace, philistine cyclical
                        everyday time. (…) Time here is without event and therefore almost seems to
                        stand still. Here there are no “meetings,” no “partings.” It is a viscous
                        and sticky time that drags itself slowly through space (<span class="ref"><span class="xref xrefblue"><a href="#B2_ref" data-ref="BAKHTIN, M. Teoria do romance II. As formas do

<p>At the end of his analysis of different chronotopes throughout the history of the
                    discourse genre of the novel, he states that “Art and literature are shot
                    through with <i>chronotopic values</i> of varying degree and scope”

<p>Bakhtin’s concept of chronotope refers to the empirical extra-discursive reality.
                    “A literary work’s artistic unity in relationship to an actual reality is
                    defined by its chronotope” (<span class="ref"><span class="xref xrefblue"><a href="#B2_ref" data-ref="BAKHTIN, M. Teoria do romance II. As formas do

<p>However,</p>
<div><blockquote><p>As we have already said, there is a sharp and categorical boundary line
                        between the actual world as source of representation and the world
                        represented in the work. We must never forget this, we must never confuse –
                        as has been done up to now and as is still often done – the
                            <i>represented</i> world with the world outside the text
                        (naive realism) (…). All such confusions are methodologically impermissible

<p>This does not justify the idea that there is no relationship between them:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>The work and the world represented in it enter the real world and enrich it,

                        renewing of the work through the creative perception of listeners and
                        readers (<span class="ref"><span class="xref xrefblue"><a href="#B2_ref" data-ref="BAKHTIN, M. Teoria do romance II. As formas do

    A knot that is impossible to untangle.">10</a></sup></span> knot of ambiguities” due to
                    its countless interpretations and uses. Holquist refers to the two parts of the
                    essay “Forms of Time and of the Chronotope:” the first one written from 1934 to
                    1937 and the second, in 1973. The first part was written when Bakhtin was
                    concerned about the theory of the novel. For example, he analyzes the way
                    Goethe’s understanding of time frames his narrative. The second was written when
                    he had returned to the metaphysical interests of his youth and his dialogue with
                    Kant. Holquist explains that Bakhtin adopts the Kantian notions of the divided
                    self and the non-coincidence between consciousness and knowledge and the
                    empirical reality of the world. This understanding breaks with the Cartesian
                    idea of the “transparent I.” Nevertheless, Bakhtin disagrees with Kant’s
                    categories of space and time, which are <i>a priori</i> and
                    transcendental. For Bakhtin, space and time integrate the empirical and
                    historical concreteness.</p>
<p>Holquist thus focuses on the complexity of Bakhtin’s text and concludes that
                    Bakhtin’s discussion on the concept of chronotope during his mature years, that
                    is, a few years before his death in 1975, delineates the limits of his analysis
                    and places it in the discursive dimension. He compares Bakhtin and Kant once
                    again.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>Another huge difference between Kant and Bakhtin (…) [is that] Kant famously
                        never raises the question of language’s role in negotiating appearance. For
                        Bakhtin just the opposite is the case: he is as focused on language as Kant
                        was dismissive of it. (…) if time and space have their “natural” home in
                        logic and science, chronotopes have their natural – their only – home in
                        language. In our daily use of chronotopes the abstractness of time-space is
                        domesticated when we deploy them in speech (<span class="ref"><span class="xref xrefblue"><a href="#B8_ref" data-ref="HOLQUIST, M. A fuga do cronotopo. Tradução de Ivan Marcos Ribeiro e

<p>We agree with Holquist and come to a first conclusion. We use Bakhtin’s words in
                    which the space-time unit of the chronotope is seen as expression and is endowed
                    with the form of a sign:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>We somehow manage however to endow all phenomena with meaning, that is, we
                        incorporate them not only into the sphere of spatial and temporal existence
                        but also into a semantic sphere. This process of assigning meaning also
                        involves some assigning of value. But questions concerning the form that
                        existence assumes in this sphere, and the nature and form of the evaluations
                        that give sense to existence, are purely philosophical (although not, of
                        course, metaphysical) and we will not engage them here. For us the following
                        is important: whatever these meanings turn out to be, in order to enter our
                        experience (which is social experience) they must take on the <i>form
                            of a sign</i> that is audible and visible for us (a hieroglyph, a
                        mathematical formula, a verbal or linguistic expression, a sketch, etc.)

<p>We also conclude, now from a methodological standpoint, that Bakhtin himself
                    provides us with “the boundaries of a chronotopic analysis” and the definition
                    of the limits of the research that uses this concept. He does it when he
                    establishes that the object of the human sciences is discourse. Therefore, as we
                    are not historians, geographers, philosophers, architects, or engineers, “our”
                    chronotope must always be circumscribed to the dimension of language.</p>
<h3 class="articleSectionTitle">2 The Starting Points</h3>
<p>We begin by stating that it is possible to use categories and concepts Bakhtin
                    developed to discuss verbal language and literary art to analyze verbal-visual
                    or visual materialities. Thus, we face the challenge of considering that, in
                    general, it is possible to understand the performance of dance choreography as a
                    discourse that can be pertinently analyzed through the concepts of discourse
                    genre and chronotope.</p>
<p>As to the latter, which it the object of this study, a caveat is in order. We
                    will not discuss the chronotopes of the represented stories of the different
                    ballets. We approach the choreographies of <i>The Dying Swan, The Afternoon
                        of a Faun</i>, and <i>The Rite of Spring</i> from the genre
                    perspective and not from the specificity of each narrated story, for the same
                    story that uses the same music can be represented in different choreographies
                    and be inscribed in other discourse genres whose social and aesthetic values
                    change radically. We know that, from a Bakhtinian standpoint, if values are
                    altered, the aesthetic object is not the same anymore. This is the case of the
                    street dance version of <i>The Dying Swan</i>, created by
                    choreographer and dancer John Lennon da Silva.<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn40_ref" name="xref_fn40" data-ref="13 
    It was analyzed in our previous article.">13</a></sup></span> The same happened to <i>The Rite of Spring</i>, which
                    was represented by different choreographers of the genre called contemporary
                    dance. The most well-known radical transformation was carried out by German Pina
                    Bausch’s choreography to the company <i>Tanztheater Wuppertal</i>.</p>
<p>We take into account that the history of ballet and dance develops through the
                    hybridization and creation of genres. Based on that, a task was assigned in our
                    previous study, that is, to identify typical choreographic utterances. Such
                    generic utterances recurrently occur in different choreographies and thus became
                    an object of our interest insofar as they affirm the same social and aesthetic
                    values. As we continue this line of methodological inquiry, we will work on the
                    concept of chronotope in its close relationship with the values of genre as they
                    are materialized in the spatial-temporal dimension.</p>
<p>The corpus of this study is comprised of three discursive fragments from YouTube
                    videos. We analyze the tense dialogue between them and the genre that is
                    conventionally called classical ballet. The analysis thus starts with the latter
                    and its specificities to carry out the analysis of the former.</p>
<p>The classical ballet genre reaches its pinnacle and materializes its values in
                    typical utterances and in the chronotope of the theater, constructed in several
                    western countries during the 19th century and the first half of the 20th
                    century. We will specifically refer to the following theaters:
                        <i>Mariinsky</i> in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and
                        <i>Châtelet</i>, <i>Opéra Garnier</i>, <i>Théâtre
                        des Champs Elysées</i> in Paris, France, constructed in this
                    chronological sequence. The data from French Wikipedia are in the Appendix.</p>

<p>Although these places are not only different, but are from different dates and
                    have different architecture, our first analytical hypothesis is that, in terms
                    of the classical-romantic ballet discourse genre and the values that penetrate
                    their typical utterances, they pertain to the same chronotope. We thus should
                    analyze their characteristics.</p>
<p>The layout of concert hall of the four theaters is known as “Italian theater,”
                    which is a large U-shaped room with a wide and elevated stage. This ensures
                    great visibility to the audience. The absolute boundary between audience and
                    stage is concretely established.</p>

<p>The specific characteristics of this space only work if they are intrinsically
                    related to the specific characteristics of time: there is a scheduled time to
                    start and end the show; there is a right time for the audience to enter and
                    leave the room; there is a right time for the audience to applaud or otherwise
                    to boo, etc. When the space of performance is coordinated with these moments, it
                    is shown or hidden; it is closed or opened. Thus, we see that this chronotope
                    outlines another important component of the genre according to Bakhtin: the
                    relationship with the listener-spectator, which is entirely regulated as the
                    regular audience knows the rules and adheres to them.</p>
<p>Another important element of the chronotope is stage lighting as it sets the
                    timespace of the show: when the lights go down, the scene unfolds and the show
                    starts; when the lights are turned back on, the show ends or an intermission of
                    the show’s discursiveness occurs. We should also discuss the space-time of the
                        applauses<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn49_ref" name="xref_fn49" data-ref="22 
    A variant of applause is the codification of classical ballets that are
                        comprised of frames (ballet à tableaux): scenes are created
                        to include a solo, a duo, a trio, etc. of a virtuosic nature whose end is
                        marked by a pause in music playing or dancing. The paused scene signals to
                        the audience that this is the right time to applaud the dancers even if the
                        lights are down. When the applause ends, the dancing and the plot resume.
                        See, for example, the renowned ballet Le Corsaire by Marius
                        Petipa (1818-1910).">22</a></sup></span> which somehow can be
                    understood as a small chronotope, related to the general chronotope described.
                    In this chronotope, lights are on, but the performers and the audience are still
                    in the theater. Although spatially separated, they establish a direct dialogue:
                    applauses and shoutings of “bravo!” are responded with the performers’ codified
                    body movements of gratitude and possible expressions of smile or emotion. Going
                    to and from the scene does not mean disappearance and appearance, but a response
                    to the audience that continues to applaud. The <i>timing</i> of this
                    dialogue is also conventional and understood by the audience: even when the
                    applause is fervent and prolonged, it has to stop; after a series of
                    applauses/gratitude movements, the performers do not return to the stage and the
                    audience leaves the theater.</p>
<p>When a spectator leaves the theater during the show, not many interpretations can
                    be offered. It is possible to say that his/her departure is equally codified.
                    Unless there is a problem – for example, a spectator feels sick – his/her
                    leaving the theater may be interpreted as his/her disapproval of the show. It is
                    logical to state that if several spectators leave, the first hypothesis is
                    discarded. In addition, the disapproval of some may somehow influence how the
                    others will respond, possibly stimulating hesitant spectators to leave the
                    theater as well.</p>
<p>What does the chronotope of the theater<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn50_ref" name="xref_fn50" data-ref="23 
    The expression “chronotope of the theater” will be used throughout the text
                        to always refer to large western national theaters that were built until the
                        beginning of the 20th century.">23</a></sup></span>
                    typified here allow us to say? What aesthetic-social values of
                    classical-romantic ballet genre are realized in it? To answer these questions,
                    we resort to an example of the exemplary ballet genre, namely, the famous
                        <i>The Dying Swan</i>, created in the <i>Mariinsky
                        Theater</i> in Saint Petersburg in Russia. The theater is a center of
                    excellence for Russian professionals of the art of ballet: dancers, musicians,
                    choreographers, costume designers, etc. We focus on Mikhaïl Fokine, who is
                    considered the great master of the transition to romanticism, valuing not only
                    technique, but also dramatic expressiveness.</p>
<p>In our previous study we concluded that every classic ballet choreography affirms
                    the idea of elevation as a value. The verticality to heights indicates a schism
                    with the daily world. It offers an image of ideality in which the lightness of a
                    nearly diaphanous body frees it from the weight and disarray of our daily
                    gestures. This leads to the use of pointe shoes, which elongate the body and
                    place it at a higher level. Legs and arms, feet and hands reach for heights. The
                    same happens with the use of light fabrics, such as the tulle of tutus. The
                    hierarchization between both worlds is clear as the elegance of the forms and
                    the delicacy of the colors point to a sublimated and purified humanity.</p>
<p>Body measurements are entirely proportional and harmonic. Nothing is off or out
                    of place. In addition, there is a predominance of line over volume. The body is
                    combined with a costume that highlights length and slenderness. Specifically in
                        <i>The Dying Swan</i>, the dramatic nature of the proximity to
                    death is expressed and emphasized through the tension between high and low,
                    flight and the immobility of death.</p>
<p>The device of the stage establishes a play of presence/absence,
                    visibility/invisibility, aided by light effects and scenography as well as the
                    alternation between getting on and off the stage. The darkness, which the
                    performer penetrates to disappear to the audience and from which he/she emerges
                    without being seen, engenders apparition and mystery theatricality in which,
                    once again, the value of breaking with the everyday world is consecrated.</p>
<p>The stage is immense in all dimensions: width, height and depth, which
                    accentuates the magical nature of every technical device – sets, costumes,
                    lighting, etc. The large velvet curtains, a noble and imposing fabric, not only
                    intensify theatricality but also isolate and protect the performers. The
                    relationship between the interlocutors, viz., the performers and the audience,
                    is thus established, contributing to thematizing the separation between the
                    ordinary and the extraordinary.</p>
<p>The access to the world of art as a sphere of elevation starts with the entrance
                    to the theater and continues through the luxuriously decorated corridors,
                    staircases, halls, etc. The monumental internal staircase leads the audience to
                    their seats, which are hierarchically arranged according to their purchasing
                    power and class. This hierarchy is inverted: the highest level (balcony)
                    corresponds to the lowest purchasing power whereas the lowest level (orchestra),
                    to the highest purchasing power.</p>
<p>The façade of the buildings itself indicates that the special world one enters
                    has nothing in common with the everyday and banal reality. At the <i>Opéra
                        Garnier</i> Theater in Paris, the external and internal staircases
                    highlight the very sense of elevation. All these spaces to be walked through
                    acquire meaning in the temporality that crosses them: the time before the show,
                    the waiting time, and the expectation time that advances towards the great
                    moment when the lights go down and the show begins.</p>

<p>We consider the chronotope of the theater as constitutive of the classical ballet
                    discourse genre. The author integrates it in his/her process of choreography
                    creation similar to the dancer in his/her interpretation. The same can be stated
                    about the spectator: his/her gaze is informed and enformed by the
                    characteristics of this spacetime continuum. Regarding the chronotopic condition
                    of the author and the listener as “real people,” Bakhtin states that they</p>
<div><blockquote><p>are all located in a real, unitary and as yet incomplete historical world set
                        off by a sharp and categorical boundary from the
                            <i>represented</i> world in the text. Therefore we may call
                        this world the world that <i>creates</i> the text, for all its
                        aspects – the reality reflected in the text, the authors creating the text,
                        the performers of the text (if they exist) and finally the listeners or

                        the creation of the represented world in the text. Out of the actual
                        chronotopes of our world (which serve as the source of representation)
                        emerge the reflected and <i>created</i> chronotopes of the world

<h3 class="articleSectionTitle">3 Modernity</h3>
<p>The birth of the so-called modern ballet,<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn54_ref" name="xref_fn54" data-ref="27 
    It is important to differentiate modern ballet form the so-called
                        contemporary dance, which has been around since the 1960s. German Pina
                        Bausch is the most representative choreographer of the genre.">27</a></sup></span>
                    as staged in the aforementioned great theaters, is a result of a true event of
                    meaning. From its origin, Nijinski<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn55_ref" name="xref_fn55" data-ref="28 
    Vaslav Nijinski was a Russian ballet dancer and choreographer of Ukrainian
                        origin (1889-1950).">28</a></sup></span> has
                    been considered a genius until today. A dancer who became famous not only in
                    Russia, but also in Western Europe at his time, he was acclaimed for combining
                    virility and grace and for his athletic and technical skills to perform
                    unparalleled high leaps with which he crossed the whole length of the stage.
                    Still as a dancer, he shows his rebel nature when he decides to free himself
                    from the expectations of the audience. In documents of the time and in his
                    diaries we find his criticism of choreographies that were totally predictable
                    with highly skilled leaps that were performed as if in a circus show or with
                    sentimentalism of sappy affectation. He then decides to create his own
                        choreographies.<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn56_ref" name="xref_fn56" data-ref="29 
    Other artists have contributed to the emergence of modern dance. This is
                        surely the case of American Isadora Duncan (1877-1927), who performed in
                        Europe with great success as early as in 1902. Her performances, however,
                        took place in private venues and were not institutionalized or put on by
                        state companies or theaters.">29</a></sup></span></p>
<p>His desires and courage were supported by equally daring Russian impresario Serge
                    Diaghilev. He founded the company <i>Ballets Russes</i>, with which he
                    toured around Western Europe and presented the best ballet dancers of the
                        <i>Mariinsky</i> Theater. Both decided to create a ballet based on
                    Debussy’s composition titled <i>Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune</i>
                    [Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun], which is based on Mallarmé’s poem
                        <i>L’après-midi d’un faune</i> [<i>The Afternoon of a
                        Faun</i>]. Together they visited museums – especially the
                        <i>Louvre</i> in Paris, where they meticulously observed vases and
                    other objects from Antiquity so as to identify features of the aesthetics to
                    which myths and the character of the Faun belong.</p>
<p>Mallarmé’s very poem is based on poet Ovid (43 AC) and the legends in which the
                    faun and the nymph fall in love but cannot consummate their idyll. Both the poem
                    and the ballet suggest that everything might be the faun’s dream, or his
                    drunkenness, or his music that conjures up magic. Satyr is an incarnation of
                    Dionysus, the god of dance and drunkenness. He appears in the ballet, eating
                    bunches of grapes and playing the flute.</p>
<p>The faun or the satyr is a combination of a man and an animal. His lower body
                    resembles a goat. In the choreography recorded by Nijinski’s writing, the
                        <i>pas de deux</i> place animality in the faun’s relationship with
                    the nymph and reveal extreme sensuality. At the end, the nymph gets off the
                    stage and leaves her scarf. The faun sees himself alone and gets sexually
                    excited with the nymph’s scarf. He lies facing down on it, clearly evoking a
                    sexual act. The ballet ends when the faun reaches an orgasm.</p>

<p>Despite its explicit nature, the aesthetics of the Faun’s ballet does not aim at
                    a realistic representation. To choreograph the legend of the Faun and his nymph,
                    Nijinski reproduced the body postures as they appear on Egyptian vases: side
                    view of faces, arms, and hands, and frontal view of the torso. Instead of long
                    and continuous gestures of classical ballet, here the animality is highlighted
                    by the heavy aspect of the lower body of the faun and his oblique and
                    interrupted gestures. Along with set and costume designer Léon Bakst,<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn58_ref" name="xref_fn58" data-ref="31 
    Léon Bakst (1866-1924) was a Russian painter, decorator and costume
                        designer.">31</a></sup></span> the scene was idealized to reduce depth
                    and create a surface aspect similar to paintings on objects of ancient art.
                    Dancers are basically on the same plane: no effects of perspective and ascending
                    verticality are used.</p>
<p>Nijinski showcases a true and concrete aesthetic reflection: art referring to
                    art. Instead of repeating and celebrating the values of the traditional
                    aesthetics of ballet, he questions the very notion of aesthetics, making it
                    plural.</p>
<p>This is a highly meaningful example of the principle of otherness that operates
                    within the aesthetic form: art speaks to (or fights) art. Does it mean that this
                    is a purely abstract form of art or, as one may put it, “art for the art’s
                    sake”? Absolutely not. This is a <i>tension of form</i> that attests
                    to a clash between social-aesthetic values. In “The Problem of Content,
                    Material, and Form in Verbal Art,” Bakhtin criticizes what he calls “material
                    aesthetics” and states that</p>
<div><blockquote><p>Form, understood as the form of a given material solely in its
                        natural-scientific (mathematical or linguistic) determinateness, becomes a
                        sort of purely external ordering of the material, devoid of any axiological
                        constituent. What fails to be understood is the <i>emotional-volitional
                            tension of form</i>—the fact that it has the character of
                        expressing some axiological relationship of the author and the contemplator

<p>The value of discursive openness and plurality of <i>The Afternoon of a
                        Faun</i> is confirmed in the following year’s choreography of the
                    ballet <i>The Rite of Spring</i>, whose music was commissioned from
                        Stravinsky.<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn60_ref" name="xref_fn60" data-ref="33 
    Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971) was a Russian composer.">33</a></sup></span> The theme now is the
                    pagan Russian myth about the cycle of renewal of life and the earth through the
                    seasons of the year and the alternation between old age and youth, birth and
                    death. Bakhtinian readers immediately refer to the popular aesthetics of the
                    carnival, and in this ballet, in fact, this aesthetics is found in the
                    re-creation of dances and rites of the popular and profound Russia. However, the
                    laughter and irreverence of the Bakhtinian theme are not found. Despite its
                    popular and peasant origin, this is a religious rite: the most beautiful young
                    woman from the village is chosen to be sacrificed: her death is an offering to
                    the gods.</p>

<p>If we compare the young woman’s death in Nijinski to the death of the swan in
                    Fokine, we see the clash of two aesthetics.<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn62_ref" name="xref_fn62" data-ref="35 
    Nevertheless, Fokine and Nijinski were contemporaries and members of the
                            Mariinsky and the Diaghiliev company. This attests to
                        the fact that, from a historical standpoint, the modern and the classical
                        are not values that are tightly separated, whether chronologically or
                        institutionally.">35</a></sup></span> In the <i>Swan</i>, there is no discontinuity of
                    gesture or line – not even at the final moment of death: even death is
                    harmonious and sublimed. In Nijinski, however, the agony and panic that lead up
                    to the final moment are expressed through nonsensical and asymmetrical gestures
                    and movements as if the young woman’s body were falling apart. Everything seems
                    to emphasize the violent nature of the scene: obsessive and strenuous
                    repetition; punches on the floor; trembling legs; arms that swing frantically,
                    and long and clumsy steps as if one leg no longer moved. Since it evokes a body
                    that is out of control, nothing resembles the melancholic, delicate, and
                    harmonious nature of the swan’s agony.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an interesting detail seems to be a type of Nijinski’s
                    signature. The <i>Faun</i>’s ballet ends with a spasm of joy whereas
                    the last scene of the <i>Rite</i>’s ballet, marked by a powerful
                    musical chord, is the spasm of death: the sacrificed young woman’s arm falls
                    abruptly and the lights go out. The body of this aesthetics is a body of spasms
                    – a living body that pulsates. Although nothing here is realistic, the dance
                    discourse does not aim to be sublimed by the ethereal. Nijinski’s choreography
                    totally breaks with the values of the classical romantic ballet of his time.</p>
<p>One of the remarkable features of this ‘other’ aesthetics in <i>The Rite of
                        Spring</i> is the position of the feet as dancers have not only to wear
                    the pointe shoes skillfully but also to move – better yet – dance inwardly. As
                    to the leaps, although existent, they do not produce movements across the stage:
                    they are compulsively fixed at the same point. Movements are not soft or
                    gracious; they are vigorous and repetitive, evoking the violence of the
                    irruption of life and the rite of death. Instead of upward verticality, it is
                    the earth that is valued: many movements are performed low to the ground and the
                    dancers, accompanied by intensely rhythmic music, hit the floor with their hands
                    or feet.</p>
<p>Instead of long, upward movements, lines are made at wrist height and hands point
                    flatly downwards or upwards. Clenched wrists point upwards in collective scenes,
                    evoking fight gestures. Movements of accentuated dissymmetry are also made as
                    upper and lower limbs move disorderly. Bodies are in a state of madness, or – if
                    we want to cling to the literal theme of the ballet – they are possessed by the
                    operating forces of the pagan ritual. The emphatic marking of the rhythm with
                    marching or jumping feet produces sounds that, unlike classical ballet, do not
                    hide the weight and strength of the bodies. These valued choices by the artist
                    point to an aesthetics usually called primitivist.</p>
<p>Nijinski’s first choreography premiered with a Russian troupe of ballet dancers
                    and the role of the Faun was played by him. The premier show was held in 1912 at
                    the <i>Châtelet</i> Theater in Paris, the same theater where
                    Diaghilev’s company had performed Russian creations of classical ballet. The
                    second choreography, <i>The Rite of Spring</i>, also premiered in
                    Paris with the same company at <i>Champs Elysées</i> Theater in 1913.
                    The ballet’s premiere in May, after musical concerts in March, marked the
                    inauguration of the newly built theater. As we have discussed before, although
                    it is located in a different space, was built on a different date, and has a
                    different architecture, the theater’s chronotopicity can be analyzed as being
                    the same as that of the other theaters based on the relationship established
                    with the discourse of classical ballet genre. The <i>Champs
                        Elysées</i> Theater has innovative architecture of a markedly Art Deco
                    style; however, this does not change the chronotopicity that makes it possible
                    to realize the values characteristic to the hitherto established genre.</p>
<p>If this analytical hypothesis is plausible, we need to try to understand the
                    effect produced by both ballets, namely, <i>The Afternoon of a
                        Faun</i> and <i>The Rite of Spring</i>. The former provoked
                    negative reactions by spectators and newspaper critics of the time. The latter
                    caused a real scandal.</p>
<p>We have discussed that the choreographed body of <i>The Afternoon of a
                        Faun</i> dialogues with other arts and material that had focused on the
                    same object. It is noteworthy that the subtitle of the ballet is <i>A
                        Choreographic Poem</i>.<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn63_ref" name="xref_fn63" data-ref="36 
    The complete title printed on the program and the poster was
                            L’après-midi d’un faune. Poème chorégraphique
                            [The Afternoon of a Faun: A Choreographic Poem].">36</a></sup></span> The
                    faun, as a discursive object, speaks through many voices – of the
                    representations on Antiquity vases, of the myth, the poem, the musical
                    composition, etc. There are at least five references of artists who addressed it
                    in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, namely, Mallarmé, Manet,
                    Gauguin, Débussy, and Nijinski. All of this, however, seems to have been
                    disregarded in the interpretation made by most spectators.</p>
<p>From a dialogical perspective, we can still state that <i>The Afternoon of a
                        Faun</i> and <i>The Rite of Spring</i> respond to the
                    aesthetics of classical ballet by polemizing with it and questioning it. Without
                    the reference to classical ballet, it would be impossible to understand the
                    schisms they create. If so, the event of meaning can be understood as a
                        <i>chronotopic transgression</i>.</p>
<p>We thus understand that without the chronotope of the theater it would be
                    difficult to understand Nijinski’s scandal. In her celebration to nature Isadora
                    Duncan danced almost naked in private salons and that did not produce the same
                    event of meaning. The <i>Faun</i> and the <i>Rite</i>
                    transgress the values supposedly shared with their spectators, and his admirers
                    are frustrated because Nijinski denies them the value placed on spectacular
                    virtuosity. Instead, the <i>Faun</i> proposes extremely slow gestures
                    and movements that encourage the idea of a dreamed scene, a daydream in a hot
                    afternoon. The stage’s reduced depth and perspective evoke the aesthetics of
                    flat paintings more than grandiose theatricality. In the <i>Rite</i>,
                    the rhythmic violence, asymmetrical bodies, vigorous gestures, and the
                    attractive force of the stage floor from which the movements seem to be
                    engendered erase any image of lightness, softness or purity that come from an
                    idealized world of the heights. During the performance, the rules of interaction
                    between interlocutors were also broken. Although this is a theatrical device
                    based on which the relationship between stage and audience should follow the
                    rules of the classical genre of performance, boos and whistles hindered dancers
                    from hearing the music; in addition, Diaghilev, who was in charge of the show,
                    was forced to turn on the audience lights several times.</p>
<p>The transgression we have identified requires that we discuss the role of the

<div><blockquote><p>(...) the whole formal structure of speech depends to a significant degree
                        upon what sort of relationship the utterance is in to the implied identity
                        of evaluations of that social milieu to which the utterance is directed.
                        Creatively productive, assured and rich intonation is possible only when a
                        ‘supporting chorus’ is assumed.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>In both of Nijinski’s ballets, the supposed addressee is understood as a
                    spectator of a high social class and <i>habitué</i> to great theaters;
                    a subject who has been introduced to ballet references, or rather, to a
                    discursive memory in which several aesthetic references that traverse the bodies
                    could be mobilized to produce meaning. The choreographic discourse equally
                    addresses the intellectual and artistic vanguard of the time, once Mallarmé’s
                    poetry and Debussy’s and Stravinsky’s music had been identified and adopted as
                    precursors of modernity at the end of the previous century. From the perspective
                    of an amplified scope of chronotope,<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn65_ref" name="xref_fn65" data-ref="38 
    A methodological issue arises: to discuss this broad-scope chronotope we need
                        to focus on the discursiveness engendered in it before analyzing it. For
                        example, we could have investigated the newspapers of the time and articles
                        on literary criticism and other arts, but this has not been done for this
                        study.">38</a></sup></span> we
                    are in Paris, in the theater that introduced the Art Deco style, and the winds
                    of modernity blew stronger and stronger in the first decade of the 20th century.
                    A proof of this change is the fact that, in 1913, the portrait of Isadora Duncan
                    was engraved in high relief in the same <i>Champs Elysées</i>
                    Theater.</p>
<p>We would thus have the “supporting chorus” that seems to have participated
                    internally and inherently in the created form. Some intellectuals of the time,
                    such as Jean Cocteau, highly valued Nijinski’s creation. Some established a
                    relationship between the <i>Faun</i>’s ballet movement and Cubist
                    painting. But they were few. Even Stravinsky and Debussy expressed their lack of
                    understanding of the choreographies Nijinski created for their compositions.</p>
<p>Addressing as a relation of otherness is one of the axes of the Bakhtin Circle’s
                    conception of language. The <i>other</i>, who is summoned and to whom
                    one responds, intrinsically participates in the discursive construction and its
                    production of meaning. In our analysis, the difference between supposed
                    addressee and real addressee is bluntly revealed. Most of the audience that
                    actually and effectively watched both shows disapproved of Nijinski’s work and
                    did not become thus a “supporting chorus.”</p>
<p>In Vološinov’s reflection on the relationship between the artist-creator and
                    his/her listener, we notice that he does not leave much room for the presence of
                    creative transgression. Although he admits the possibility of a disagreement and
                    a tone of irritation in the utterance, he does not elaborate on the possible
                    richness proper to transgression. On the contrary,</p>
<div><blockquote><p>When this [supporting chorus] is absent, the voice breaks off and its wealth
                        of intonation is reduced, as happens to the joker when he realizes that he
                        alone is laughing. The laughter either ceases or dies away, becomes
                        strained, loses assurance and clarity and is unable to produce any funny or
                        jovial words (Vološinov, 1983, pp.14-15).<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn66_ref" name="xref_fn66" data-ref="39 
    For reference, see footnote 26.">39</a></sup></span></p></blockquote></div>
<p>We believe that in art it is impossible to understand transgressive and
                    avantgarde creation without the concept of superaddressee. Voloshinov outlines
                    elements to define this concept when he mentions the “third participant”
                    (Vološinov, 1983, p.15),<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn67_ref" name="xref_fn67" data-ref="40

                    Bakhtin who clearly defines it.</p>

                        presupposes (with a greater or lesser degree of awareness) some higher
                        instancing of responsive understanding that can distance itself in various

<p>We can say that the superaddressee frees the work from the interpretive limits of
                    its context, its evaluative purview, its “supporting chorus,” and takes it to a

<p>Regarding “Nijinski’s scandal,” we conclude that the choreographic discourse
                    introduced values that transgressed those embodied in the chronotope of the
                    theater. Thus, it went beyond the space-time unit in which it was engendered; it
                    danced towards the great time and addressed its art to the emerging purview of
                    modernity. A future chronotopicity? One thing is for certain: Nijinski broadened
                    the purview of values of the chronotope of the theater so as to open it to new
                    values of dance discursiveness. Today contemporary dance is performed in
                        <i>Champs Elysées</i> and <i>Châtelet</i> Theaters –
                    some performances are extremely radical in their discursiveness, such as the
                    ones by the Brazilian company <i>Grupo Corpo</i> or by Pina
                    Bausch.</p>
<h3 class="articleSectionTitle">Conclusions</h3>
<p>We want to conclude this article focusing on the issue of transgression, revealed
                    as the main element of our analysis. We brought a historical example of
                    chronotopic transgression produced by a radically innovative choreographic
                    discourse, the precursor of a new genre that would later be known as Modern
                    Ballet. We would like to end with an example of the inverse process, that is,
                    the transgression of the meaning of a classical choreographic discourse,
                    produced by the change of the chronotope.</p>
<p>We need to contextualize it first. We are in France, in January 2020, when huge
                    popular protests took place against ultraliberal reforms of the Macron
                    government, especially the reform of the pension system. Almost every single
                    category of waged workers is on the streets, and a transportation strike
                    paralyzes the country for over a month. Taking into account that in large cities
                    of France life depends entirely on public transportation, the daily life of
                    self-employed workers who are not on strike becomes deranged. For them to go to
                    work, they need to ask for rides, ride bicycles, rollerblade, or walk, which
                    doubles or triples commuting time. Despite the disturbance caused, 65% of the
                    population supports strikers. Besides rallies, several types of protests were
                    staged. Truck drivers closed roads; port workers shut down ports; electrical
                    workers cut power supplies for a few hours; lawyers tossed their black robes on
                    the steps of the Palace of Justice… and ballet dancers from the <i>Opéra
                        Garnier</i>’s corps de ballet danced outside this traditional
                    theater.</p>

<p>We can identify the chronotope of the square or the street, a central element in
                    Bakhtin’s work on Rabelais and popular culture. We are in open space, the
                    distance between the stage and the audience is relativized, and time breaks free
                    from the codified regulations of performances that occur in the theater. The
                    orchestra, which is also there, plays “Swan Lake,” composed by Tchaikovsky for
                    the namesake ballet,<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref"><a href="#fn71_ref" name="xref_fn71" data-ref="44 
    It was created in the Bolshoi Theater Ballet in Moscow in 1877 by different
                        choreographers.">44</a></sup></span> which is the most
                    renowned classical ballet. At the same time, the sounds from the street break
                    free from any control and affect the scansion of “listening” by altering the
                    measurement of music <i>time</i>: horns, sirens, voices.</p>
<p>The source of lighting is daylight, which falls on everyone – artists and
                    audience alike – and does not produce an effect of magic or mystery. In the gray
                    cold of Paris, the scene is clear and transparent. The values of the popular
                    chronotope are imposed on the ballet discourse, introducing it in the collective
                    discourse. On the imposing arcades of the theater, protest banners are hanging.
                    They take the role of a new component of verbal discourse, replacing the
                    programs distributed before the shows: “Opera On Strike,” “Culture in danger.”
                    The façade, the entrance, the arcades, and the staircase are the same, but now
                    they have a new chronotopic dimension. The verticality of the imposing noble
                    stone arcades is reduced by horizontal banners whose material, layout, and
                    verbal content point to a popular origin with fighting value.</p>
<p>We thus see the political dimension of the chronotope, once
                        <i>polis</i> is the space for living together; in addition, the
                    way places and positions are distributed within it configures a political regime
                    of shared artistic sensibility. In this Parisian “protest ballet,” the
                    space-time of the theater is reconfigured, and the tension between the values of
                    the two chronotopes is the one that produces meaning intensity and density. Here
                    we can identify the relationship between the chronotope and the empirical
                    reality as Bakhtin points out.</p>
<p>The relation of otherness is the core of discursive meaning production: it is
                    because that place refers to an art of the “heights” that the “lowness” of the
                    street can be given voice. It is insofar that the entrance to the <i>Opéra
                        Garnier</i> conventionally means an index of the values of the art of
                    elevation that the difference with the chronotope of the street and the values
                    of the social movement of protest is contrasted. As the choreography, music and
                    costumes of the classical genre are maintained, the voice of traditional art
                    joins the voice of popular manifestations, and the dance body joins the
                    collective body. Here the artist not only serves a political cause, but also
                    adheres to it. It is the very presence of classical and traditional forms of the
                    body and the theater that gives force to discourse, establishing an effective
                    dialogue between the popular and the cultured through the articulation between
                    the ethical and the aesthetic.</p>
<p>Should we conclude that every single transgression is creative? Not really. We
                    need to consider if transgression only undoes what is established or if it
                    allows affirming new values. In case it does, what discursiveness does it
                    assume? In any case, because of values, this discussion will always go beyond
                    the methodological dimension: it requires that the researcher have a
                        <i>non-indifferent thinking</i> in face of the new affirmed

                        comprised of frames <i>(ballet à tableaux):</i> scenes are created
                        to include a solo, a duo, a trio, etc. of a virtuosic nature whose end is
                        marked by a pause in music playing or dancing. The paused scene signals to

                        lights are down. When the applause ends, the dancing and the plot resume.

<h3 class="articleSectionTitle">Review I</h3>
<p>The title is appropriate to the development of the article, which focuses on
                        analyzing the choreographies created by Nijinski as transgressors of the
                        chronotope of classical theater. It refers to the generic classification of
                        classical ballet proposed in a previous study and to the notion of
                        chronotope as a “chronotopized” matrix of a set of social and aesthetic
                        values, which the author conveniently illustrates. He/She carefully analyzes
                        the staging of two ballets, namely, <i>The Afternoon of a Faun</i>
                        and <i>The Rite of Spring</i>, to show which aspects of the
                        classical understanding of the body in motion are transformed and
                        questioned. He/She thus proposes the hypothesis of a cultural change towards
                        modernity through the Russian dancer’s provocative transgression of
                        corporalities and other choreographic languages. The study is also concerned
                        about pointing out the public’s negative responses to this new
                        interpretation of meaning in the performance of the fable. It is evident
                        that the Bakhtinian theory about the theoretical concept of chronotope is
                        known and quoted in a convenient and updated way in relation to the created
                        world and to the creative and receiving image on that difficult border
                        between the reality of the author and the audience and its textualized
                        representation. This becomes very complex in the theatrical text. In my
                        opinion it should at least be pointed out as <i>a conflictual
                            issue</i> between the creative consciousness and the created world
                        and between the potential and the real receiver. Finally, I highlight the
                        adequacy of the paper to the format and language of a scientific work in its
                        development and rigor in many of its facets. My evaluation is positive as I
                        understand it as a successful intent to transfer a somewhat ambiguous
                        theoretical category to other artistic discourses that are thought within a
                        diachronic development, as Bakhtin does with the novel. As a suggestion, I
                        propose that Nijinski’s production not only be presented as a reference to
                        previous social aesthetics, but that it be given a new name that takes into
                        account its intrinsic and synchronous characteristics in order to evaluate,
                        as Bakhtin puts it, the form of “assimilation,” that is, to artistically
                        compose Nijinski’s real historical chronotope and bear witness to that
                        space-time in the very performances. ACCEPTED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS</p>

<h3 class="articleSectionTitle">Review II</h3>
<p>The article presents an important and up-to-date discussion on the performing
                        arts (dance and theater) theoretically and methodologically grounded in the
                        studies of the Bakhtin Circle. The language presented is scientific and its
                        analyses and results will greatly contribute to the areas of knowledge with
                        which the text dialogues. The title and abstract are adequate and fully
                        relate to the content of the work. The publication of the article in
                            <i>Bakhtiniana: Revista de Estudos do Discurso</i> will
                        certainly offer possibilities of non-stigmatized readings on classical
                        ballet, once the path chosen by the author is provocative in the sense that
                        he/she mobilizes meanings and not simply affirms or categorizes them. The
                        density and rigor dedicated to the work not only justify, but also encourage
                        its approval for publication. I noticed, on the list of bibliographical
                        references, that Voloshinov is spelled with an ‘s’ and not with a ‘c,’ as it
                        is found in the referenced work. ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION</p>
