<p>Apesar de terem sido estudos realizados por autores diferentes e de certa forma
                    independente um do outro, as teorias das Implicaturas de Paul Grice e dos Atos
                    de Discurso Indiretos de John Searle não apenas estão intimamente ligadas como,
                    na verdade, são complementares entre si, de modo que se mostra de crucial
                    importância a compreensão dos dois juntos, a fim de se obter um maior domínio da
                    noção de “não literalidade” das enunciações. Este trabalho tratará de mostrar as
                    principais características de ambas as teorias e como elas se inter-relacionam
                    orgânica e simbioticamente.</p>

<h1 class="articleSectionTitle">ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Although these are studies performed by different authors and in a certain way
                    independent from one another, the theories of Implicatures by Paul Grice and of
                    Indirect Speech Acts by John Searle are not only deep linked but, in fact, are
                    mutually complementary, for we can see the crucial importance of the
                    comprehension of both of them in order to obtain a better grasp on the notion of
                    “Non-literality.” This work will show the main properties of both theories and
                    how they work together in an organic and symbiotic way.</p>

<h1 class="articleSectionTitle">Introduction</h1>
<p>The contemporary study of the language admits as indispensable the
                        <i>pragmatic</i> dimension of the discourse for a more complete
                    comprehension of the aspects and laws which govern the efficient and rational
                    interaction of the ordinary conversation. However, it was not easy to introduce
                    the notion that the utterance as <i>use</i> could really bring us a
                    contribution for a precise understanding of these alleged laws, mainly when that
                    notion seemed to complicate more than explain.</p>
<p>It was in 1975 that Paul Grice presented a paper called <i>Logic and
                        Conversation</i> which would cease once and for all the preconception
                    that there was in thinking that the natural language was intrinsically not
                    systematic and that the everyday communication used to happen almost like an
                    accident. For Grice, couldn’t be by chance the fact that the people could
                    understand each other with a high degree of precision without a minimum mental
                    organization in order to get that effect.</p>
<p>The idealism of the logicians and mathematicians who defended that the language
                    should be <i>always</i> given by a formal notation permitted a more
                    precise and well delimited relation among the linguistics phenomena, but, in the
                    other hand, it <i>simplified</i> them a lot, making many of the
                    details present in the dialogues even from the people who have never had contact
                    with the Linguistics, like irony or the “drop of a hint,” were left behind and
                    the objective of a satisfactory cataloging of these phenomena was itself
                    boycotted by the means of its viabilization (that is, the language sciences).
                    Grice intended to find a way to conciliate the formal and the natural, but
                    without allow these losses to occur: “this logic may be aided and guided by the
                    simplified logic of the formal devices but cannot be supplanted by it” (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Grice, 1975</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>GRICE, H. P. Logic and Conversation. William James

                    Grice.</span></span></span>, p.43).</p>
<p>In 1969, John Searle, a student under the guidance of the “father” of Speech Acts
                    Theory, John L. Austin, brought a better sophistication of that theory with his
                    book <i>Speech Acts</i> and reformulated the taxonomy proposed by his
                    professor. In 1979, with his <i>Expression and Meaning</i>, he related
                    with this study several topics of the Philosophy of Language, which versed from
                    the problems of Reference (the Descriptivism of Bertrand Russell, Peter Strawson
                    and Keith Donnellan, already mentioned in <span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Searle, 1969</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>SEARLE, J. R. Speech Acts. New York: Cambridge
                    University Press, 1969.</span></span></span>, p.157) to the problems of Signification (literal and
                    metaphorical meaning) in <i>Mind, Language and Society</i> (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Searle, 1998, p.140</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>SEARLE, J. R. Mind, Language and Society. New York:
                    Basic Book – The Mastermind Series, 1998.</span></span></span>) about the sentence
                    meaning (lexical) and the speaker meaning (who takes the liberty to alter
                        <i>as much as possible</i> the literal meaning in order to achieve
                    some linguistic interest). This initiative inspired him to think about the
                        <i>indirect</i> speech act phenomenon which defied the traditional
                    notion that says that the comprehension of an utterance was only possible or, at
                    least, <i>optimized</i>, if the people stuck to the literal meanings
                    of the expressions.</p>
<p>On practical terms we see that the violation of the so said <i>constitutive
                        rules</i> (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Searle, 1969</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>SEARLE, J. R. Speech Acts. New York: Cambridge

                    of the communication, meaning, the basic laws which <i>form</i> and
                    allow the transmission of the information from a person to another, is in fact
                    “planned” by the participants of the conversation, although not based in an
                        <i>exactly</i> conscious way and we’ll see how this works together
                    with Grice’s Implicature theory.</p>
<p>Let us analyze now the details of the Implicature and Speech Acts theories and
                    how the <i>dependency</i> between them takes place.</p>
<h1 class="articleSectionTitle">1 Implicature Theory</h1>
<p>Suppose a situation where the person 1 arrives at a bus stop and asks the other
                    person 2 who was already there: “Hi. Do you know if the bus X has passed by
                    here?” The other then says: “I’m waiting for it.” The person who asked,
                        <i>then</i>, thanks for the answer and stays at the stop waiting
                    for the bus. This situation is so common that we don’t realize the strangeness
                    of what happened. We ask: how is it possible that we are satisfied with the
                    answer offered above until the point that we thanked 1 as a
                        <i>consequence</i> of that answer? The question made
                        <i>demands</i>, in theory, an answer of the “yes or no” kind, but
                    the answer given <i>didn’t</i> only indirectly omit this content but
                    has involved the speaker 2 himself, who represents <i>null
                        interests</i> for 1. Why then 1 has gotten satisfied with the
                    enunciation from 2?</p>
<p>What has occurred was the following (let us suppose that they were two men):
                    although 2 didn’t answer as he “should” to the 1’s question, instead of it
                    meaning that 1 didn’t understand him, 1 not just obtained the answer that he
                    needed but he also acquired other information which could be useful to him in
                    several ways. In fact, 1 <i>supposes</i> that 2 is a person mentally
                    “stable” whose decisions are made in a rational way and if 2 said that he was
                    waiting for the bus to come, he has <i>hidden</i> (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Levinson, 1983</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>LEVINSON, S. C. Pragmática. Tradução de Aníbal Mari

                    it,” because if the bus has already passed by that way, he would not be there to
                    talk to 1; he would have boarded the vehicle.</p>
<p>This opens space for the conversation <i>to continue</i> or to think
                    that something else has been said there, because 1 could also suppose that the
                    bus X has already passed by in the presence of 2 at the stop, but maybe it could
                    be full of people or even could have ceased to work and 2 was unable to board
                    it. Both could start to discuss about the governmental neglect concerning the
                    public transportation due to the long waits until the arrival of the vehicles,
                    about the quality of the journey or even about the population rise.</p>
<p>We can note how much relevant information was hidden in the 2’s decision in
                    giving the answer that he gave, instead of a simple negative phrase. 2 had the
                        <i>intention</i> to wake on 1 a tendency to a conversational
                        <i>cooperation</i>, considering that, for example, the inclusion
                    of the personal problems in an enunciation which <i>strictly</i> would
                    exclude them (the content should be restricted to a “yes or no”) shows
                        <i>empathy</i> and <i>interest</i> to help 1, which goes
                    beyond the mechanical and impersonal discourse and brings a more
                        <i>complete</i> e <i>efficient</i> answer. Now we can
                    see how much the 1’s thanking is more than justified!</p>
<p>Another important fact which we cannot avoid noting is that the 1’s question was
                    if 2 <i>knew</i> whether the bus X has passed or not. 2 could
                    perfectly answer this: “yes, I know whether it has passed or not.” This
                    enunciation, by the way, is considered the <i>exact</i> answer which 2
                    could have given. However, if 1 had received this, not only he <i>would
                        not</i> obtain the desired answer, but he probably would get angry with
                    2, who has shown complete indifference to the 1’s problems and has not given a
                    simple answer in an <i>informative</i> way. 2 could also say “yes”
                    intending to convey that in <i>some time</i> of the day the bus passed
                    by there, which is not relevant to 1’s purposes, who wanted to estimate how much
                    time it would take for the next bus of the route to pass and, for that, he would
                    have to know when the most <i>recent</i> one passed. Thus, what would
                    the logicians say in this case if the cult of the form, which should make the
                    informational exchange more <i>precise</i>, would turn it totally
                    useless and a way to make people fight each other?</p>
<p>Grice calls this hidden information <i>Implicature</i> (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Grice, 1975</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>GRICE, H. P. Logic and Conversation. William James
                        Lectures, delivered at Harvard University in 1967, and to be
                    published by Harvard University Press. Copyright 1975 by II. Paul
                    Grice.</span></span></span>, p.43) and it could be
                        <i>conventional</i> or <i>conversational</i>. He decided
                    to invent this name so we could not confuse this with the more common notion of
                    “implication,” which content is obtained by <i>logical</i> and not
                        <i>contextual</i> inferences. The main characteristic of an
                    implicature is the fact that it is a <i>not conventional</i>
                    information (although we will see that, <i>due to conventions,</i> we
                    can generate implicatures) which is conveyed <i>intentionally</i> by
                    the speaker, although <i>not necessarily</i> the hearer is always able
                    to understand it. Precisely because of this hiding of the propositional content
                    “inside” or “behind” the words and expressions, it is always possible to
                        <i>cancel</i> the implicatures, although it is perfectly possible
                    that these hidden senses turn to be conventional, as has been shown with the bus
                    example above. In few words, what 2 <i>wanted to say</i> is different
                    from what he said, but the biggest novelty is that the implicature <i>does
                        not restrict itself</i> to just ambiguities, ironies or metaphors.</p>
<p>The implicatures of the <i>conventional</i> kind are those hidden
                    information which depend on the conventions to be executed. More precisely,
                    conventions which can delimit a standard meaning (lexical) for the words. For
                    example, in “she is blond, but she writes well,” although in logical terms we
                    are in front of a conjunction (Bx ^ Wx) of properties Bx (“x” is blond) and Wx
                    (“x” writes well) concerning an individual “x,” <i>grammatically</i>
                    we have a double attribution made by an <i>adversative</i> conjunction
                    (“but”) and it should only be used when the first clause has, in some sense, an
                    opposite idea if compared with the second clause. There is an offensive
                        <i>cultural presupposition</i> which says that women with a blond
                    hair are normally intellectually unable, meaning that someone who actually
                    believes in such absurdity supposes adverse the situation where we can find a
                    blond woman who writes well, which is an activity that demands a reasonable
                    mental effort. Therefore, due to the convention attributed to the meaning of
                    “but” it was possible for the speaker to hide this hateful preconception and
                    convey it in an indirect form. It is important to note that, despite the
                    existence of this presupposition, not all people <i>share</i> this
                    information and, considering that, what the speaker said by implicature might be
                    easily ignored (canceled).</p>
<p>By the way, the case above illustrates a good reason for us to not depend
                    completely on the Classical Logic to deal with the everyday conversation,
                    because while this point of view sees the cited case as a simple conjunction of
                    properties, a pragmatic perspective reveals many others
                        <i>adjacent</i> information which, in fact, were precisely what
                    the speaker <i>wanted to say</i> at the end of day. The literally
                    spoken was reduced to a simple <i>vehicle</i> of the real information
                    that the speaker desired to convey.</p>
<p>The implicature of the <i>conversational</i> kind, on the other hand,
                    are those which are of more interest to Grice, because they are
                        <i>independent</i> of any previous conventional notion (formally
                    established, as grammatical terms) and still surprise us by being constantly
                    utilized and comprehended without further problems. So, how are we capable to
                    understand each other without the sharing of a clear and efficient constitutive
                    rule? Grice will argue that, in fact, such rules <i>do exist</i>,
                    although they are not utilized in a strictly <i>formal</i> (exact) and
                        <i>explicit</i> way, neither they are utilized in a rigorous sense
                    which we could call by a “<i>clear</i>” <i>conscious
                        process</i>, but in an <i>intuitive</i> way.</p>
<p>In fact, it is precisely because of this <i>shared</i> pattern by
                    everyone or, at least, this would be the impression that we have, that Grice
                    defends that in all rational informational exchange the participants of the
                    conversation are <i>observing</i> (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Grice, 1975</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>GRICE, H. P. Logic and Conversation. William James

                    only violates this good sense in a <i>planned</i> way. That is, the
                    participants of the conversation <i>calculate</i> that <i>there
                        must be a reason</i> why the speaker has not used the conversational
                    norm to enunciate what he has enunciated and that he is enunciating
                        <i>something else</i> (the implicature). This calculus will
                    determine the <i>probability</i> to deduce which something else was
                    that, because it is obvious that, by being cancelable, the implicature cannot be
                    fixed, but it is relative to specific elements of the context.</p>
<p>Despite that, there are some situations in which Grice argues that certain
                    implicatures have a <i>high degree of non-detachability</i> (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Grice, 1975</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>GRICE, H. P. Logic and Conversation. William James

                    in multiple and diverse contexts. For example, someone would only say of a
                    married man that “he went to see a woman” (using, on purpose, the indefinite
                    article) if the speaker was implying that this man will commit adultery
                    (otherwise he would have said “his wife”).</p>
<p>In any case, there is always an assumption that the hearer does not make
                    irrational decisions and that he does not act aimlessly, randomly. Participants
                    always expect this from each other. According to Grice:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>to calculate a conversational implicature is to calculate what has to be
                        supposed in order to preserve the supposition that the Cooperative Principle
                        is being observed, and since there may be various possible specific
                        explanations, a list of which may be open, the conversational
                            <i>implicatum</i> in such cases will be disjunction of such
                        specific explanations; and if the list of these is open, the implicatum will
                        have just the kind of indeterminacy that many actual implicata do in fact
                        seem to possess (1975, p.58).</p></blockquote></div>
<p>By “disjunction” Grice means the fact that the correct interpretation of the
                    speaker’s purpose in making his utterance is included in a logical list of
                    interpretations given by “A or B or C or...,” in which the capital letters mean
                    each one of the possible meanings that the hearer can assume until he calculates
                    the correct answer: what the speaker hid and really meant.</p>
<p>It is of great relevance to note that by “conversational norm” it is not meant
                    here that everyone has read the grammar and “perfectly” mastered the canonical
                    and modern way of communicating. The highlighted term means that no matter how
                    informal or “tribal” the exchange of information is, it is essential that there
                    be a minimum of regulative rules so that even the most “primitive” (that is,
                    distant from what we commonly call “civilization”) of linguistic interactions
                    fulfills the constitutive role of being able to communicate something. CP is a
                    notion that helps a language with (sufficient) already established rules to
                    maintain a good sense of regularity that allows a minimum informational
                    exchange.</p>
<p>With the CP in mind, we ask: what does it consist of? Grice describes it as an
                    abstract and intuitive guide that constantly “tells” us: “Make your
                    conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it
                    occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you
                    are engaged” (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Grice, 1975</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>GRICE, H. P. Logic and Conversation. William James
                        Lectures, delivered at Harvard University in 1967, and to be

                    Grice.</span></span></span>, p.45). The CP
                    is composed of four fundamental categories that give rise to maxims
                    (suggestions) of behaviors. They are: the categories of
                        <i>Quantity</i>, <i>Quality</i>,
                        <i>Relation</i> and <i>Mode</i>.</p>
<p>The Quantity category guides us to the maxim of not being more or less
                        <i>informative</i> than the conversational exchange
                        <i>requires</i>. Violating it can cause confusion of ideas due to
                    the large amount of information or unwanted inferences due to the lack of it.
                    The Quality category guides us to the maxim that the communicated information
                    must always be <i>true</i> or, at least, that there is a minimum
                    effort to present some evidence for it (that there is a true belief about it).
                    Violating it can cause distrust or serious consequences to the hearer who acted
                    believing in a falsehood. The Relation category guides us to the maxim that the
                    communicated information must always be <i>relevant</i>. Violating it
                    can cause an unnecessary deviation from the topic of the conversation and
                    completely miss the purpose of the interaction in question. Finally, we have the
                    Mode category, which guides us to the maxim that we should always communicate
                    information in the most <i>obvious</i> way possible. Violating it can
                    cause ambiguity or a lack of interest in the conversational interaction.</p>
<p>It is clear that if we could know <i>exactly</i>, respectively to the
                    categories, how much, what, about what and only about what we
                        <i>should</i> talk, there would be no conversation, because, in
                    theory, there would be only one thing to be said. We could not expect Grice (or
                    anyone else) to provide us with a law that tells us <i>how</i> we
                    could <i>perfectly</i> respect these maxims, and <i>there is
                        no</i> metaphysical parameter that demonstrates when we speak in the
                    most informative way <i>possible</i>, although that is the function of
                    language, according to the author (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Grice,

                        connected with them, are specially connected (I hope) with the particular
                        purposes that talk (and so, talk exchange) is adapted to serve and is
                        primarily employed to serve. I have stated my maxims as if this purpose were
                        a maximally effective exchange of information.” For reference, see footnote
                        1. Expressions like “I hope” shows that Grice did not have the intention to
                        show a perfectly exact theory.</span></span></span> By “possible” he
                    means how far our cognition can take us.</p>
<p>So, it is important to highlight that Grice did not intend with this exposition
                    to beg the principle by stating that <i>it is possible to know
                        unequivocally</i> in advance when we are, for example, maximally
                    relevant, even though the CP should precisely guide us to this (it would be
                    absurd to start the composition of a principle from notions which that same
                    principle proposes to expose/define), but that, at least, we
                        <i>try</i> and <i>believe</i> that we are trying to do
                        <i>our best</i> for such a task. His contribution was to delimit
                    four main categories apparently essential for the description of a legitimately
                    rational (not perfect) conversation, based on mostly
                        <i>empirical</i><span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref">3</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span class="refCttPadding"><strong class="fn-title">3</strong>“A dull but, no doubt at a certain level, adequate answer is that it is just
                        a well-recognized empirical fact that people DO behave in these ways; they
                        have learned to do so in childhood and not lost the habit of doing so; and,
                        indeed, it would involve a good deal of effort to make a radical departure
                        from the habit. It is much easier, for example, to tell the truth than to
                        invent lies” (Grice, 1975, p.48). In
                        this excerpt, Grice comments that CP arises from childhood and that we carry
                        it into adulthood out of pure habit. That is, it would be much more
                        difficult to abandon this habit than to maintain it. He sets the example
                        that it is easier to tell the truth than to lie.</span></span></span> facts.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to understand how it is possible to calculate the
                    conversational implicature. Participants in a conversation will always reckon
                    that everyone involved is constantly observing these maxims, so that if one of
                    them is violated by a speaker, the hearer will assume that he is still
                    cooperating and that there must be a reason why he has violated it. In the case
                    of the bus above, speaker 1 thinks as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I. I asked a “yes or no” question, but 2 did not answer that way (he has
                            violated the maxims of quantity and relevance);</p></li>
<li><p>II. I assume he wants to cooperate. Saying “I'm waiting for it” should
                            contain the answer that interests me;</p></li>
<li><p>III. By definition, one only waits for something if this something has
                            not yet come into contact with the person waiting for it or there was an
                            exceptional reason why, even when in contact, it did not occur at a time
                            or in an opportune way;</p></li>
<li><p>IV. Any one of these reasons would be enough for me, <i>as well as
                                2, not</i> to have entered the bus;</p></li>
<li><p>V. Therefore, regardless of whether the bus has passed or not, it is best
                            for me to wait for the bus as 2 is waiting.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We can see that the answer “no,” hidden by 2 and <i>expected</i> by 1,
                    is highlighted in item IV. It is more informative than the “no” of saying that
                    “the bus <i>didn’t</i> come while I was here” (which would be the
                    standard cooperative response) or the “no” of saying that you just don’t know,
                    because 2, as a reasonably prudent person, may also have meant with “I'm waiting
                    for it” that the bus passed, but the space was full, or that the tire went flat,
                    the engine broke down, or even that the vehicle was being stolen by criminals
                    etc. All these possible inferences demonstrate a greater empathy of 2 in
                    relation to 1 and 2 was “maximally” cooperative. All of this takes place in
                    fractions of a second, despite how complex it may <i>seem</i>.

<h1 class="articleSectionTitle">2 Indirect Speech Acts</h1>
<p>To understand what indirect speech acts are about, we must first explore the
                    general notion of Speech Act Theory. The Speech Acts are the way in which we can
                        <i>act</i> and <i>change</i> the world <i>only
                        through enunciation</i>, going against the old notion that language
                    served only to describe the facts of reality. Although we already notice traces
                    of this theory in Saint Augustine, in the <i>De Magistro</i> (1980) of
                    389 AD (on the difference between action and speech), in <i>The

<p>These types of utterances occur, for example, when a baby is
                        <i>baptized</i> by a recognized clerical authority; a president

                    appropriate circumstances specified above “is not to describe my doing of what I
                    should be said in so uttering to be doing or to state that I am doing it: it is

                        he unifies components 3 and 7 into a single so-called “degree of
                        strength.”</span></span></span> This new conception, which he called
                    “Performative” and it is the opposite of what he called “Constative” (the
                    previous view of language, the one that observes, describes) shook the
                    structures of what was known about language.</p>
<p>By the way, the constative, as its name means, has the function of verifying,
                    describing and reporting what “occurs” (in the ordinary conception of the term).
                    That is, they are statements that, depending on the state of affairs to which
                    they refer, can be classified as true or false (according to the reasoning of
                    the Law of the excluded middle of Logic, without a third option).</p>
<p>With the notion of performative, an idea was created contrary to the possibility
                    of giving (only) a <i>truth value</i> to the utterances, and it is now
                    possible to speak of conditions of <i>satisfaction</i>. If we look
                    closely at a performative, for example, a prediction, we can realize that even
                    if someone who made a mistake about the fact that would happen according to what
                    he said, we cannot deny that the prediction was made. Now, this means that it is
                    not up to us, it does not seem appropriate, in this case, to judge what was said
                    as a “falsehood,” because someone needed to have uttered it first and to have
                    “given” <i>reality</i> to the prediction as a fact in the world, whose
                    origin could only have been that one, to be evaluated somehow later. That is,
                    the enunciation already needed to be true (as a true fact that occurred in the
                    world) so that we could say something about it later (whether its propositional
                    content corresponds or not to the facts of the world, for example). Therefore,
                    what starts to matter from then on is not whether the enunciation occurred or
                    not, but what were the consequences of its manifestation in the world. In this
                    situation, we say that the prediction was <i>infelicitous</i>, flawed,
                    unproductive, vain, but <i>never</i> false (although its propositional
                    content may be obviously false. In this case, the speaker did not
                        <i>satisfy</i> the prediction he made).</p>
<p>The speech act is composed of several stages (although not spaced apart in time),
                    ranging from the very means of enunciation (locution) through the speaker’s
                    intention of action (illocution) until the effects that such speech causes in
                    the hearer (perlocution). Regarding the intention, the speaker’s objective, we
                    call it an <i>Illocutionary Act</i>, which has an
                        <i>Illocutionary Force</i> that delimits one or more of the
                        <i>five</i> general types of possible illocutionary acts, and this
                    will be the stage that really interests us in understanding the notion of
                    indirect (illocutionary) speech acts.</p>
<p>Formally, the illocutionary act is given by “F(P),” where “F” is its
                        <i>constitutive</i> force and “P” is the relevant propositional
                    content on which the speaker acts through the act. An illocutionary act has
                    certain <i>conditions of success</i> (conditions that the speaker must
                    fulfill in order to perform a given intended act) and certain <i>conditions
                        of satisfaction</i> (conditions that must be obtained in the world in
                    order to make the speaker’s goal be achieved while he is performing an act). In
                    the work by <span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Searle and Daniel Vanderveken,
                            <i>Foundations of Illocutionary Logic</i> (1985)</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>SEARLE, J. R.; VANDERVEKEN, D. Foundations of Illocutionary
                        Logic. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1985.</span></span></span>, we
                    find the structure of an illocutionary act in chapter 2, item III, p.12. It is
                    composed of seven<sup>24</sup> basic components that constitute its conditions
                    of success:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><i>Illocutionary point</i>: it is the speaker’s main objective
                            when he is enunciating something. E.g.: if someone wants to promise, he
                            puts himself in a commitment to someone.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Mode of achievement of the illocutionary point</i>: defines
                            the way in which the speaker intends to accomplish his objective. E.g.:
                            one can get another to do him or her a favor either by begging or
                            asking.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Degree of strength of the illocutionary point</i>: it is the
                            capacity of an enunciated act to reach the intended objective. E.g.:
                            “beg” has a higher degree than “ask.” It is interesting to note that
                            whoever begs is at the same time asking, but not the other way
                            around.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Propositional content conditions</i>: defines the type of
                            content on which the act can deal. E.g.: you cannot make a prediction
                            about the past or declare a library now as “inaugurated” next year.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Preparatory conditions</i>: defines what must be presupposed
                            so that the act can be carried out. E.g.: it is necessary that the
                            person who will perform the baptism of a child have some appropriate
                            title of authority.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Sincerity conditions</i>: defines which psychological state
                            is being <i>expressed</i> during the performance of an act.
                            E.g.: whoever makes a statement is expressing his belief that the
                            propositional content is the case (even if he does not really believe
                            it, which characterizes what we call a “lie”).</p></li>
<li><p><i>Degree of strength of the sincerity conditions</i>: the
                            degree of strength of the illocutionary point is closely linked with how
                            much the speaker wants to achieve his objective. E.g.: the person who
                            begs wants a certain thing to happen more than the person who just
                            asks.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These components are necessary for us to understand what are the success and
                    satisfaction conditions of the illocutionary act. Although every act is a
                    successful attempt, it can be performed <i>defectively</i> (e.g., when
                    a speaker believes that the content of his promise is of benefit to his hearer,
                    but it is not) or it can be <i>failed</i> (e.g. when a speaker tries
                    to fire an employee of a company by saying “I hereby declare you fired from this
                    company” without having the necessary authority to do so). An act carried out
                        <i>without defect</i> is, for example, when someone makes a
                    promise fulfilling the following conditions: it is necessary that that person
                    meets the preparatory conditions so that one can carry out the action with which
                    one has committed oneself and it is of benefit to the hearer; meet the sincerity
                    conditions that one intends to fulfill the promise; and meet the propositional
                    content conditions that it is a future action. Having fulfilled one’s promise
                    (i.e., if the future events took place <i>because</i> of one’s promise
                    and for no other reason) we say that one’s promise has been performed without
                    defect and it was <i>satisfied</i>. This act is a <i>plainly
                        happy</i> act.</p>
<p>So if that person says “I promise to go to the movies with you tomorrow” (one has
                    accomplished the commissive illocutionary point, with a commissive force), as
                    long as one manages to communicate this in some way, the act has been
                        <i>performed</i> (one has <i>tried</i> to accomplish
                    something to the hearer <i>already putting oneself</i> in a commitment
                    with him or her). This person has done so with the “degree = //promise//” (which
                    is less than “degree = //swear//,” for example, as this puts the speaker into a
                    commitment with the further preparatory condition that one risks the loss of a
                    value that is important to him or her, such as “I swear on my mother” etc.) and
                    this characterizes a way of achieving “mode (//promise//).” However, the act
                    will only be <i>satisfied</i> if the promise is actually fulfilled,
                    i.e., if the future events of the promise’s content were fulfilled <i>due
                        to the speaker's actions</i> in favor of this outcome (in this case,
                    going to the cinema with the hearer tomorrow).</p>
<p>The fact that the speaker did not manage to fulfill what he promised <i>does
                        not</i> mean that he was being <i>insincere</i> about his
                    ability or intention to fulfill it. This also <i>does not</i> mean
                    that the speaker uttered “nothing.” The hearer could say: “you promised, but you
                    didn't keep it. That was not a promise! It was like you were silent.” Searle
                    argues that the act is defined <i>at the moment</i> the speaker
                    decides what he intends to accomplish, and that instant is a fixed and
                        <i>real</i> moment in the world (Searle’s Naive Realism). If he is
                    accused of lying, this will not remove the <i>pre-existing</i>
                    sincerity that there was in his intention, even if this reveals an
                    epistemological problem about the following question: how can we know that he
                    was sincere? As we are not omniscient, we say that only the speaker will know
                    and we should expect accessible evidence to contribute to the elucidation of
                    this fact.</p>
<p><span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Searle, in <i>Expression and Meaning</i>
                        (1979)</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>SEARLE, J. R. Expression and Meaning. New York:
                    Cambridge University Press, 1979.</span></span></span>, will present the taxonomy of types of illocutionary acts and
                    the goals we can accomplish. For him, that number is exhausted at
                        <i>five</i>. He believes that in practice we would hardly have any
                    type of act that does not fit into this classification.</p>
<p>In order to get a better understanding of this classification, however, the
                    notion of <i>Direction of Fit</i> is first necessary (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Searle; Vanderveken, 1985</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>SEARLE, J. R.; VANDERVEKEN, D. Foundations of Illocutionary
                        Logic. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1985.</span></span></span>, p.92). There are
                    four directions in the relationship between speech and the world (objects of
                    reality): 1. <i>Language-world</i>: when we describe the world as it
                    is, that is, when the content of the enunciation fits the world; 2.
                        <i>World-language</i>: when the world must adapt to the content of
                    what was stated; 3. <i>Double-direction</i>: when the enunciation,
                    under the right conditions, <i>transforms</i> and at the same time
                        <i>describes</i> the world as it is; 4. <i>Null
                        direction</i>: when the enunciation is <i>irrelevant</i> to
                    the constitution of the world and only expresses a psychological state in
                    relation to it.</p>
<p>By the way, such directions of fit are actually grounded in an even more
                    fundamental realm than speech acts themselves. <span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Searle, despite having written his work <i>Speech Acts</i> in
                        1969</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>SEARLE, J. R. Speech Acts. New York: Cambridge
                    University Press, 1969.</span></span></span>, noticed only later <span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">(1983)</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>SEARLE, J. R. Intentionality. New York: Cambridge
                    University Press, 1983.</span></span></span> that the functioning of speech acts was based on a more
                    primitive mental property which he called <i>intentionality</i> (a
                    word that also names the work in which he talks about this property,
                        <i>Intentionality,</i> 1983). Intentionality is about our
                        <i>directional</i> capacity which relates mental states to objects
                    and states of affairs in the world. As the name implies, it is naturally based
                    on this directionality that the directions of fit between mental states and
                    things are founded, and when someone has the intention of performing an
                    illocutionary act and expressing one of these states (e.g., an affirmation is an
                    expression of a belief in the truth of the expressed propositional content or an
                    order that expresses the desire that the hearer perform a future action to the
                    speaker or a promise that expresses an intention to carry out a future course of
                    actions in favor of his hearer), the directions of fit of mental states are
                    “transferred” to the illocutionary acts performed.</p>

                    with the world. They are the <i>Network</i> and the
                        <i>Background</i>: “According to Searle, speech acts do not
                    function in isolation. They are embedded within a ‘Network’ of unarticulated
                    beliefs and other mental states and within a ‘Background’” (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Fotion, 2021</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>FOTION, N. John Searle. Encyclopedia Britannica.

            </a></span></span>, about the entry “John
                    Searle”). In other words, the network connects the various concepts we use in
                    such a way as to allow us to understand, for example, that if someone invites us
                    to go to a restaurant, that person knows that only go to restaurants those who
                    know what it means to be hungry, to have a meal, sitting at the table, money,
                    etc. On the other hand, the background is a more problematic concept, as <span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Daniel Barbiero (2004)</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>BARBIERO, D. Background, the Dictionary of Philosophy of
                        Mind. Disponível em: https://sites.google.com/site/minddict/background-the,

            </a></span></span> says in the
                        <i>Dictionary of Philosophy of Mind</i> in the entry “Background,
                    the.” Searle had to define, to avoid the infinite regress that we “represent
                    representations” in order to understand them, a non-representational plane
                    (assuming this negation is no longer a representation; and another regress would
                    arise. This is why it is problematic) on which we have a <i>deep</i>
                    dimension and another <i>local</i> dimension. Deep down, the human
                    mind must be able to perform <i>innate</i> and
                        <i>universal</i> skills (there would be a lack of representation)
                    such as walking, eating and simply seeing in order not to bump into things. In
                    the local dimension, the human mind must be able to identify some objects and
                    behaviors that are almost naturally recognizable in a given culture or minimally
                    defined society (such as knowing that a fork serves to bring food from a plate
                    to one’s mouth). Without these primary elements of the mind, we would not be
                    able to perform any kind of speech act, direct or indirect, and therefore,
                    Searle defends the primacy of the mind over language.</p>
<p>Back to the classification, we have <i>Assertives</i>: which describe
                    the world and present reasons in doing that and therefore have direction of fit
                    1. E.g.: affirm, assert, describe, etc.; the <i>Directives</i>: whose
                    function is to make the other carry out something of the speaker’s desire or
                    order and therefore have direction of fit 2 with regard to the
                        <i>hearer</i> (the latter’s actions must suit the content of the
                    enunciation). E.g..: command, ask, pray, etc.; the <i>Commissives</i>:
                    which commit the speaker to a certain future course of his actions and therefore
                    have direction of fit 2 with regard to the <i>speaker</i> (the
                    latter’s actions must suit the content of the enunciation). E.g.: promise,
                    consent, threaten etc.; <i>Declarations</i>: allow us to define a
                    feature of the world under the right conditions, which automatically describes
                    it, and therefore have direction of fit 3. E.g.: declare, name, indicate, etc.
                    Lastly, we have the <i>Expressives</i>, which merely express a
                    psychological state relative to a certain presupposed state of affairs, not
                    adding (as in Directives, Commissives and Declarations) or taking away (as in
                    Assertives) any aspect in (of) the world and have therefore direction of fit 4.
                    E.g.: apologize, thank, congratulate, etc.</p>
<p>With this in mind we can visualize why there are only five types of illocutionary
                    points: since there are only four ways of interacting with the world through
                    language, and considering the fact that directives and commissives differ only
                    in that future action of the propositional content must be carried out
                    respectively by the hearer and the speaker, counting as two types of objectives,
                    we have 3 (assertives, declarations, expressives) + 2 (directives, commissives)
                    = 5 ways of performing an action through language.</p>
<p>Knowing this, we are able to perform all kinds of illocutionary acts
                        <i>directly</i>, that is, when we <i>intend</i> to
                    perform each of these actions and <i>literally</i> use the so-called
                        <i>performative verbs</i> (such as those in the examples given
                    above) for this purpose. It is worth remembering that more than one verb of this
                    type is capable of meeting the same objective of the speaker. For example,
                    whoever asserts or describes, practices the same assertive act, but the first
                    has a greater degree of strength than the second. Although it is the same goal,
                    if the speaker has good evidence to choose to assert rather than just describe,
                    he will have his action attempt with greater efficiency and more convincing
                    power, that is, a greater degree of strength of the illocutionary goal.</p>
<h1 class="articleSectionTitle">3 On the Relationship between the Theories Seen</h1>
<p>There is, however, a way to perform illocutionary acts
                        <i>indirectly</i>. That is, by enunciating (doing) one thing, we
                    were actually wanting to do something else. If we remember correctly, this is
                    exactly Grice’s definition of implicature that we saw earlier. The main
                    difficulty of this, which makes the study quite curious, is <i>how it is
                        possible</i> for the hearer to understand that what the speaker said
                        <i>was not</i> what was “really” said. The information must have
                    been conveyed in some way, or conversation would be impossible.</p>
<p>Márcio Galvão, in his short article “Atos de fala indiretos e implicaturas
                    conversacionais” [“Indirect speech acts and conversational implicatures”] (2007,
                    p.1), highlights the method suggested by Grice “whose strength lies precisely in
                    the reconstruction of the implicit elements and indirect uses of language (…)
                    that are beyond the reach of any purely semantic or syntactic analysis.”<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref">7</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span class="refCttPadding"><strong class="fn-title">7</strong>In Portuguese: “cuja força está justamente na reconstrução dos elementos
                        implícitos e usos indiretos da linguagem (…) que estão fora do alcance de
                        qualquer análise puramente semântica ou sintática.”</span></span></span> He also highlights that, from the point of
                    view of the theory proposed by Austin, “<i>almost all use of language is
                        indirect (not explicit)</i>”<span class="ref footnote"><sup class="xref">8</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span class="refCttPadding"><strong class="fn-title">8</strong>In Portuguese: “quase todo o uso da linguagem é indireto (não

                    we have explicit performative verbs at our disposal, where there is a
                    coincidence between saying the verb and performing the act, as in “to promise”
                    and “to name,” there are certainly non-explicit (indirect) ways of expressing

<div><blockquote>
<p>Speaker: Shall we go to the movies today?</p>
<p>Hearer: I will have to study for the test.</p>
</blockquote></div>
<p>1. A proposal was made and the answer was that he has to study; 2. The hearer is
                    cooperating with the conversation; 3. A relevant (cooperative) answer would be:
                    accept or reject; 4. The answer, however, did not take this form; 5. Probably
                    the hearer meant something else; 6. Studying should take the same amount of time
                    as going to the movies; 7. Therefore he cannot do both at the same time; 8. To
                    accept a proposal, the hearer must believe that he can fulfill the commitment;
                    9. The hearer assumes that he will not be able to comply due to studying for the
                    test; 10. Therefore, he really must have refused the proposal.</p>
<p>It is evident that this analysis is <i>identical</i> to the bus example
                    above. We notice that it is in step 4 of this example that the hearer (from now
                    on, the one who made the proposal), observing the CP, <i>assuming</i>
                    in 3 that the speaker was being cooperative, <i>realizes</i> that the
                    speaker violated the maxim of <i>quantity</i> and
                        <i>relevance</i>, since the illocutionary act expected in the
                    answer would be one of the <i>commissive</i> type (the speaker would
                    commit or not to go to the cinema, respectively, accepting or refusing), but an
                        <i>assertive</i> type was found (the speaker described a situation
                    in the world, namely, that there is a test that will be given to him tomorrow
                    and it is a fact that he has to study), although we can also see it as a
                    commissive type whose commitment is to an activity other than going to the
                    cinema with the hearer (in any case way, it would still be irrelevant to what
                    the hearer expected, in addition to the fact that this view would characterize a
                    beg of a principle, since the question we are analyzing is precisely how an
                    affirmation becomes a commitment and we cannot assume so in advance). In 5 the
                    calculation of the implicature starts. In 6, the hearer perceives that there is
                    a reason, exposed in an affirmation, that would prevent the speaker from
                    accepting the proposal and this should be reason enough to assume that, if there
                    is a reason to refuse and this reason was put in evidence in a mere statement,
                    so the refusal was really what was said (the real intention of the speaker).</p>
<p>Searle calls the <i>Primary Act</i> the one which was in fact the
                    intention of the speaker, although <i>implicit</i> (in the example
                    above, the refusal), and the <i>Secondary Act</i> the one through
                    which the primary act was conveyed with the literal meaning of the words and
                    expressions used and, therefore, in an <i>evident</i> way (in the
                    example above, the one of affirmation). It then becomes clear that it is
                    possible to perform one type of illocutionary act by enunciating another, but it
                    is only due to the elements of the context that the primary act is understood.
                    In the cinema example just given, the hearer probably had
                        <i>contingent</i> knowledge (specific context) of the speaker’s
                    school obligations, which he usually fulfills; that the speaker usually studies
                    for tests for a long period of time that takes up the whole day or just the
                    scheduled time for the exhibition of the movie; also, the full knowledge
                    (general context) that it would be physically impossible to be in two places at
                    the same time.</p>
<h1 class="articleSectionTitle">4 Some Examples</h1>
<p>To conclude, we will look at the most famous examples of indirect speech acts
                    that we deal with daily without even realizing the eccentricity of
                    communication. We will use the notions of Grice and Searle and analyze each of
                    them in detail. The main feature of these acts is being able to perform one of
                    the five types of illocutionary acts <i>in the form of another</i> of
                    these five types. It is important not to confuse this with acts that occur
                        <i>at the same time</i>, as when an act of a certain degree of
                    strength obviously presupposes all acts of the same type with lower degrees of
                    strength. The high degree of informality of the examples is intentional, since
                    the objective of this work is precisely to deal with the philosophical aspects
                    of everyday language.</p>
<p>We will separate here five very common groups of types of acts that “transform”
                    into another according to the speaker’s various purposes. The symbol “→” will be
                    used to represent this transformation or, preferably, this disguise. They are
                    the <i>Affirmations</i>, <i>Questions</i>,
                        <i>Orders</i>, <i>Promises</i> and
                        <i>Assumptions</i>. According to Searle, the main motivation for
                    the speaker to opt for this disguise is the attempt to sound more well-mannered,
                        <i>polite</i>, especially when a directive or an insult is going
                    to be made, to achieve a certain <i>euphemism</i> and not make it so
                    obvious that the other is doing one a favor or fulfilling one’s wish, as if the
                    hearer owed him something or was some kind of servant of the speaker (which
                    would sound pejorative).</p>
<p>In all cases, the participants of the conversation will be watching the CP and
                    relying on each other’s conversational cooperation. However, it is very
                    important to expose the <i>exact moment</i> when this phenomenon
                    occurs, which may sound a little repetitive during the examples. Let us first
                    analyze the group of <i>Affirmations</i>:</p>
<p><i>Affirmations</i> → <i>Insults/Compliments</i>: an
                    assertive can hide an expressive when using <i>irony</i>, that is,
                    saying one thing, but meaning exactly the <i>opposite</i>. Ex.: “Mário
                    is an Albert Einstein,” meaning that he is the complete opposite of one of the
                    most revered and famous scientists in history. This example could also be used
                    as a compliment (and it wouldn't be ironic). The use of
                        <i>metaphors</i> is also a common way of indirectly insulting or
                    praising. E.g.: “Suedson is a machine” can mean that he is “automatic” and not
                    very expressive emotionally, as well as meaning that he works hard and
                    efficiently without complaining.</p>
<p>In these two cases, there is a violation of the maxim of
                        <i>relevance</i> (Relation category), when the speaker
                        <i>purposely</i> compares the individuals in question with people
                    and objects which <i>share</i> some property that should become
                    evident to the hearer who observes the CP and tries to find a reason for the
                    speaker to have “deviated” from the subject. After all, it is obvious that Mario
                    is not Albert Einstein, just as a person cannot be a machine. The main features
                    of these <i>apparently</i> irrelevant mentions become the
                        <i>center</i> of attention, precisely because they are irrelevant,
                    but the hearer <i>assumes</i> that the speaker is being
                        <i>cooperative</i>. The decision for the precise calculation will
                    depend on elements of the context.</p>
<p>We can also talk about a mother who, upon hearing the complaints of her son who
                    calls her “annoying,” replies that “your mother is the annoying one!” The son,
                    if he is smart enough, will notice that his mother apparently insulted herself
                    or, looking at the CP and counting on her cooperation, might assume that the
                    violation of the <i>quality</i> maxim means something else, because he
                    does not believe that she, responding angry to him, really thinks that she is
                    annoying. The mother’s utterance can be translated into an insult, which calls
                    her own son a bastard (after all, she insulted a supposedly other mother of the
                    boy, which was not her).</p>
<p><i>Assertion</i> → <i>Suggestion</i>: an assertive can hide a
                    directive. For example, someone might say to a friend, who clearly has a beard
                    that is too full and untidy, that “Friend, the barber has children to raise.”
                    The hearer, observing the CP and assuming the cooperation of the speaker, will
                    look for a reason why he said this “out of the blue.” The speaker may not even
                    know which barber the friend usually goes to, much less if he has children.
                    Despite this violation of the maxim of <i>quality</i>, since he has no
                    evidence to say what he said, the important thing is to note that the violation
                    of his maxim of <i>relevance</i> will awaken in the hearer what is
                    most notable in this utterance: that someone who has children need money to feed
                    them. Therefore, it would be interesting if people with excessive beards were to
                    trim it and pay for the service.</p>
<p>It is also possible to make a request via a claim. Let’s imagine a guy interested
                    in a woman at a party and, as he approaches her, he says: “I don’t know your
                    name.” The woman, observing the CP and assuming the young man's cooperation,
                    notices that, by violating the maxim of <i>quantity</i> by bringing
                    such an obviousness into the conversation, he is suggesting (asking) that she
                    tell him her name, as if the fact that the young man did not know that bothered
                    him so much that he had to <i>expose it</i>.</p>
<p><i>Affirmation</i> → <i>Commitment</i>: an assertive can hide
                    a commissive. Suppose that a boy with no money asks his neighbor to go buy him
                    some bread. The neighbor agrees to do the favor and the boy thanks her. Then she
                    says: “It will cost five dollars.” The boy, cunningly, says: “I thank you even
                    more.” In this case, it was not the neighbor’s intention to offer to pay for the
                    bread, but the young man, abusing her goodwill, made it seem that her statement
                    “it will cost five dollars” was an extension of the favor she had undertaken to
                    do. The boy, observing the CP and assuming her cooperation, proceeds to induce
                    that the neighbor has violated the maxim of <i>quantity</i>, and makes
                    it seem as if she purposely omitted that it will cost “him” five dollars because
                    she was willing to pay. We call those cases, where the implicature occurs
                    without the speaker’s intention, <i>misunderstandings</i> (even though
                    the hearer “understood” that wrong way on purpose).</p>
<p>Someone might also say, “I am ashamed of what I did.” Anyone who is ashamed of
                    something or regrets it is <i>not necessarily</i> saying that he will
                    not do what he did again. However, a hearer, observing the CP and assuming the
                    cooperation of the speaker, may assume that his violation of the maxim of
                        <i>quantity</i>, when the speaker willingly adds the
                        <i>expression</i> of regret to his utterance, implies that he not
                    only despises what he did, but he also says he won’t do it again. In this case,
                    an expressive (through an affirmation) has become a commissive.</p>
<p><i>Affirmation</i> → <i>Accusation/Confession</i>: an
                    assertive can hide a different assertive (with different propositional content
                    conditions, different degree of strength of the illocutionary point and
                    different degree of strength of the sincerity conditions). Suppose two children
                    commenting on the possibility of cheating on a school test. One of them states:
                    “you can’t cheat on the test with teacher Roberto in the classroom.” The other
                    child, observing the CP and counting on the cooperation of his colleague, may
                    end up assuming that he <i>has already tried</i> to cheat on the test
                    with teacher Roberto in the classroom at least once. This is due to the fact
                    that the speaker violated the maxim of <i>quality</i> when, instead of
                    showing <i>doubt</i> about the possibility of succeeding in cheating,
                    since that was what was being discussed, he showed “certainty,” due to the fact
                    that he had affirmed and not asked, configuring a confession on his part (which
                    is the accusation of himself, but with a greater degree of strength of sincerity
                    conditions, since we assume the belief that someone knows more about oneself
                    than others know this one). It illustrates the famous expression: “you don't
                    even know how to lie.”</p>
<p>An affirmation can also hide a prediction. Suppose a reunion of a group of
                    friends few hours before the New Year’s Eve. One of them asks a friend with a
                    watch: “Please, what time is it?” The bearer of the watch replies: “There are
                    just fifteen minutes left.” The first, observing the CP and assuming that his
                    hearer is cooperating with the conversation, assumes that it must be fifteen
                    minutes before midnight on the 31st of December. This is because the bearer of
                    the watch has clearly violated the maxim of <i>quantity</i> by not
                    saying for what time those fifteen minutes are left. That is, the hearer
                    understands (and predicts) that there is fifteen minutes to midnight even if he
                    does not have this information literally.</p>
<p>Now let’s go to the <i>Questions</i> group.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> → <i>Invitation</i>: a directive can become a
                    different directive (on conditions on the propositional content, degree of
                    strength of the illocutionary point and degree of strength of the sincerity
                    conditions). A question is a directive in the sense that the speaker is
                    requesting that his hearer fulfill his wish, namely, that he gives him some
                    information. Suppose that two friends are talking, and it is a fact that one of
                    them travels abroad every six months, while the other has never been on a plane
                    before. The first then asks the other, while buying plane tickets on a website:
                    “Have you ever traveled by plane?” The second, observing the CP and counting on
                    the cooperation of the first, assumes that the violation of the maxim of
                        <i>relevance</i> and <i>quantity</i>, when the first
                    brings up a fact that is obvious to both (that the hearer has never traveled by
                    plane) while performing an action which is clearly capable of changing it (by
                    buying tickets) might be hiding that he is inviting the other to travel by
                    plane.</p>
<p>It is also possible to make challenges with a question. Suppose that two men are
                    arguing and one of them says something that the other does not like. The hearer
                    then retorts: “what did you say?” The first person, observing the CP and
                    counting on the cooperation of the other, seeing a clear discontent in his face,
                    will certainly not assume that his hearer did not listen to what he said. In
                    fact, faced with the violation of the maxim of <i>quality</i>, the man
                    who felt offended <i>pretends</i> not to have heard what he heard,
                    actually meaning: “I dare you to say it again!” that is, a challenge.</p>
<p>We cannot fail to mention the most famous example, namely when a question becomes
                    a request. At a restaurant table, while two men are eating together, one of
                    them, who is far from the saltshaker, then asks: “could you pass the salt?” The
                    man, watching the CP and counting on the other’s cooperation, will assume that
                    the other is not asking if he has the physical ability to reach out and pass the
                    salt to him. The speaker, by violating the maxim of <i>quality</i>,
                    since he knew well that his hearer was perfectly capable of carrying out his
                    request, asked him in this way, not to know the answer, but if the friend could
                    do the favor to pass the salt (almost as if he couldn't do it, and if he did it
                    despite that, it would be a great show of kindness, which is a compliment to his
                    hearer).</p>
<p><i>Question</i> → <i>Help</i>: A directive can become a
                    commissive. Imagine two women talking and one of them is lamenting her
                    precarious financial situation. From there we can already visualize the
                    interesting case of an expressive becoming a directive, namely, that an
                    expression of dissatisfaction about something can be a request for help. By
                    violating the maxim of <i>relevance</i>, one would not have discussed
                    the matter with someone else who could not help (a stranger or enemy, for
                    example). After that, the hearer then asks the question to the complainant: “so,
                    is your problem money?” The complainant thus raises her hopes, as by observing
                    the CP and counting on the friend’s cooperation, she assumes that her
                        <i>understanding</i> of the financial problem exposed through a
                    question would probably indicate that the friend intends to help her. Violation
                    of the maxim of <i>quantity</i> suggests that she would not listen to
                    her friend and would have checked out what her problem really is (if she heard
                    her correctly) with the question if she had not intended to help. It would be
                    unfortunate, though, if whoever asked the question “Is your problem money?”
                    complete: “mine too.”</p>
<p>Next, for reasons of economy, we will see only one example respectively for the
                    Order, Promise and Assumption groups.</p>
<p><i>Order</i> → <i>Expressive</i>: a directive can hide an
                    expressive. Suppose a general who has taken great sympathy with a certain
                    battalion he has trained utters aloud the following order: “I order you not to
                    die in battle!” It is an order which is actually part of everyone’s desire to
                    fulfill, but it is not a matter of <i>choice</i>, exactly. Especially
                    if the general has tears in his eyes while making such an enunciation, it will
                    be clear to the brave battalion that, while it watches the CP and counts on the
                    general’s cooperation and in front of a violation of the maxim of
                        <i>manner</i>, to carry out an order whose propositional content
                    and preparatory conditions do not exactly (directly) concern the battalion’s
                    competence can only mean that their general wishes (and expresses this wish)
                    that they return home alive.</p>
<p><i>Promise</i> → <i>Compliment</i>: a commissive can become
                    an expressive. Imagine someone who has just launched a book and is inviting
                    friends to read it. While everyone will say they're going to read it, one of
                    them says, “That’s cool! I promise you that I will read.” The hearer, who
                    observes the CP and counts on his friend’s cooperation, assumes that his
                    violation of the maxim of <i>quantity</i>, by
                        <i>insisting</i> on using the word “promise” to emphasize his
                    commitment (since it is possible to promise by not using the explicit
                    performative, as others have) works as a compliment to your work.</p>
<p><i>Assumption</i> → <i>Affirmation</i>: an assertive can
                    become an assertive with a higher degree of strength of the illocutionary point.
                    Imagine that two competitors are playing chess and one of them, who is about to
                    perform a clear checkmate, still says to the other: “I think you lost.” The
                    audience, observing the CP and relying on the cooperation of the competitor who
                    enunciated, assumes that the violation of the maxim of <i>quality</i>,
                    when the <i>near</i>-winner (who only expects official recognition of
                    victory in the case that he intends to win) demonstrates doubt about the state
                    of affairs of the world that he won instead of certainty about it, that is to
                    say he was just trying to be polite in front of the loser, who did a great
                    game.</p>
<p>We could still mention the curious case of <i>Hybrid Illocutionary
                        Acts</i>, which, as Searle says, are “events that can be, but need not
                    be, illocutionary acts.” (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Searle; Vandeveken,
                        1985</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>SEARLE, J. R.; VANDERVEKEN, D. Foundations of Illocutionary
                        Logic. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1985.</span></span></span>, p.181). For example, we have the acts of “warning,”
                    “predicting,” or “remembering.” When we see black clouds gathering more and more
                    in the sky, this could be a forecast of rain, which reminds us to go out with an
                    umbrella in hand; the migration of certain birds, as we see them flying, makes a
                    prediction and warns us of winter; certain superstitions believe that the
                    presence of a butterfly that “accidentally” enters a house predicts some case of
                    death in the family; there is even the case of a ship builder who said it was
                    indestructible but, when he sees it sinking, he finds himself “offended” by the
                    laws of physics (or, if he is religious, by God).</p>
<p>In short, these are those acts that can be done by us, linguistic beings, but can
                    also be <i>perceived</i> (interpreted) by us from non-conscious
                    (non-linguistic) sources, as if we <i>embody</i> them. Despite being
                    direct illocutionary acts, they seem somewhat indirect, as they were not
                    “exactly” (consciously) planned, although they disguised themselves in a natural
                    event and in our common tendency to see a rational cause for any effect (in
                    general, a pattern in phenomena) as well as cooperation in conversation.</p>
<p>With that, we end the examples. It is obvious that they are countless and this
                    classification into five groups is purely <i>arbitrary</i>, with the
                    aim of illustrating only a few cases. The attentive reader may have noticed that
                    the examples of the <i>Affirmations</i> group, as well as the
                    violations of the maxim of <i>relevance</i>, are the most numerous. No
                    wonder, ordinary conversation always tries to <i>simplify</i> the work
                    for successful communication and the least expensive ways to express yourself
                    will always be the most trivial, which are the simple exposition of a thought
                    (statement) without much rigor in checking its veracity or strict relevance to
                    the subject (violation of the maxims of quality and relevance,
                    respectively).</p>
<h1 class="articleSectionTitle">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We hope to have demonstrated, as Grice wanted, that ordinary language, despite
                    its name, does not imply an empty linguistic system, much less an inefficient
                    one. On the contrary, our tendency to simplify things is so great that not even
                    Formal Logic, which intended precisely to follow this clearer and more evident
                    path of simplification, managed to deal with all the variables of a
                        <i>constant</i> impetus for the <i>reform</i> of
                    communication in favor of ease and cooperation. With the help of Grice's Theory
                    of Implicatures, which seems to be the basis for any theory within Linguistic
                    Pragmatics, we had good conditions to understand well how this other very
                    important study of Indirect Speech Acts works, which reveals all the details
                    that Grice didn't elaborate on his short article.</p>

<p>In the study, it is proposed to put in relation the theories of the Implicature,
                    of P. Grice, and of the Acts of indirect speech, by J. Searle, in order to
                    demonstrate the existing correlations between both. P. Grice’s proposal is
                    contextualized in a framework in which logical idealism seemed to enable a
                    certain precision about the phenomena, but it also simplified them too much –
                    field in relation to which it would have encouraged the author to seek to
                    reconcile formality and naturalness of phenomena. J. Searle’s proposal, in turn,
                    is situated in the unfolding of the Austian reflection, indicating a revision of
                    the taxonomy initially proposed. From this initial framework, each of the
                    perspectives is revisited in a more detailed approach.</p>
<p>In item “1. The Theory of Implicatures,” the perspective is presented based on a
                    hypothetical example. Elements such as “implicit,” “cooperation,” and others
                    forms of engagement are exposed in the presentation of the notion of
                    implicature, correlating it, then, with the cooperative principle.</p>
<p>In item “2. The Indirect Speech Acts,” J. Searle’s proposal is presented as
                    perspective whose founding traits would already be present in Saint Augustine,
                    G. Frege and L. Wittgenstein, but more accurately developed by J. Austin. In
                    that framework, the notions of “constative” and “performative” are recovered,
                    which refer to the first formulation of the theory, unfolded in the mention of
                    “locution,” “illocution” and “perlocution” and “illocutionary act” and
                    “illocutionary force.” There is also the mention of the basic notions related to
                    perspective, present in the work of J. Searle and D.Vanderveken.</p>
<p>In this item, the reformulations proposed by the author are presented, as well as
                    dialogues with other developments of the referred theory. In these first two
                    items of the article, the discussion related to each of the perspectives is
                    fundamentally based on the authors, without an explanation of the framework of
                    current reflections that even make such resumption relevant. It is suggested to
                    indicate minimally this current repercussion of the mentioned perspectives.</p>
<p>In item “3. On the relationship between the theories seen,” begins the
                    correlation between the theories presented. In the first sentence of this item,
                    the connective “but” is used, through which a contrast is introduced with the
                    end of the previous item. The development of correlation, however, is quite
                    punctual, based on hypothetical dialogue. Compared to reflective density
                    proposed in the text, this item stands out for its synthetic character, dealing
                    precisely here with what would be the original contribution of the article. Note
                    that a presentation of the theories is already available in other bibliographic
                    materials. Only in item “4. Some examples,” examples of transforming a type of
                    act into others demonstrate support on the conversational principle formulated
                    by Grice. It is by means of these examples that we seek to consolidate the
                    theoretical articulation discussed. To carry out this articulation, are placed
                    in scene vectors that refer to irony, metaphors – productive
                    theoretical-methodological inputs, present in different frameworks in the
                    discursive studies. Thus, the interpretive gestures that suppose to put the
                    notions arising from the theories under analysis are articulated and
                    substantiated by adding aspects that are also relevant in other theoretical
                    frameworks. We suggest registering at article this interaction. APPROVED WITH

<p>- The title is in accordance with the article that was developed.</p>
<p>-The author’s aim is to characterize Searle's and Grice’s theories about speech
                    acts (implicatures) and show how the two complement each other. The goal has
                    been reached fully, providing the reader with an understanding of Searle's and
                    Grice’s theories.</p>
<p>- As the author’s objective is to contrast the two theories, the sources used
                    were from the studied authors themselves, not requiring the indication or
                    support of bibliographies of another order. Therefore, the bibliography used is
                    adequate for the purpose of the article.</p>
<p>- The purpose of the article is to present the two theories and contrast them.
                    There is no approach critique of theories. The merit of the article lies in the
                    way in which the author clarifies the theories, explaining in detail the theory
                    of conversational implicatures and the theory of speech acts developed by
                    Searle, illustrating the various cases with creative examples, leading the
                    reader to understand the two theories.</p>
<p>- The text is clearly developed, with grammatical correction and adequacy to the
                        <i>language of scientific works. APPROVED</i></p>

<p>This article has already been previously analyzed by reviewers who formulated
                    their considerations, emphasizing the merit of the proposed theoretical
                    articulation established. There have been advances in orthographic revision.
                    However, there was no explanation of current links of reflections, maintaining a
                    direct relationship with the authors under examination. Item 3 remained the most
                    concise, even though it is the one with the greatest contribution of the
                    article. It is understood that maintaining these aspects is an authorship
                    option, given the contribution of the reviewers. Considering that there was
                    approval on the merits, it is suggested to publish the article. APPROVED.</p>

<p>The submitted work was conditionally rejected in its first version only for
                    formal reasons. The corrected version manages to collate in a skillful way the
                    approaches on conversation from a Gricean perspective and in the light of speech
                    act theory. I won’t say that this is properly a work of accentuated originality,
                    but it should be noted that it values for its extreme clarity and didacticism.
                    In this sense, it contributes to the available literature on the subject in
                    Portuguese. I recommend the publication without hesitation. APPROVED</p>
