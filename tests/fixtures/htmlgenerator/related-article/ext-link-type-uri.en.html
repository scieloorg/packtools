<p>Active learning is all pedagogical alternatives that place the focus of learning on the students. With the mediation of competent teachers, the students learn by discovery, by investigation, and by problems. Such methodologies commonly promote more content retention and comprehension once the students are engaged in activities, whether through research, group collaborations, discussion, and problem-solving. This work aimed to verify the temporal evolution of active learning methods in higher education Engineering courses, based on a systematic mapping of the literature. We observed which are the main researchers in this field, their geographic location, and which methodologies are preferred in the context of these courses. From the results, we observe a growth in scientific publications on active learning methodologies and Engineering Education, especially in the last five years of the period analysed (between 2015 and 2020). We also see research in this field on all continents, with a predominance of studies led by American and European researchers. In the mapped studies, the inverted classroom and problem-based learning were the most identified methodologies. It indicates a concern of teachers in this area to promote activities with high involvement, which allow the development of personal and professional skills and competencies, even during their training period.</p>

<p>As metodologias ativas podem ser entendidas como alternativas pedagógicas que colocam o foco do aprendizado nos estudantes. Com mediação de docentes competentes, os alunos aprendem a partir da descoberta, da investigação e por problemas. Tais metodologias comumente promovem uma maior retenção e compreensão de contéudos ensinados, uma vez que o aprendiz se encontra engajado nas atividades, seja por meio de pesquisa, colaborações em grupo, discussão e resolução de problemas. Este trabalho teve como objetivo verificar a evolução temporal do uso de metodologias ativas, no contexto dos cursos superiores de Engenharia, a partir de um mapeamento sistemático da literatura. A partir de um protocolo de pesquisa estabelecido, buscou-se verificar quais os principais pesquisadores desta área, sua localização geográfica e quais as metodologias preferidas no contexto destes cursos. A partir dos resultados, foi possível observar que o crescimento do número de publicações científicas sobre metodologias ativas no contexto da Educação em Engenharia, em especial nos últimos cinco anos do período analisado (entre 2015 e 2020). Pode-se notar a realização de pesquisas neste contexto em todos os continentes, com predomínio de estudos liderados por pesquisadores americanos e europeus. Nos estudos mapeados, a sala de aula invertida e a aprendizagem baseada em problemas foram as metodologias mais identificadas. Isso indica uma maior preocupação dos professores da área em promover atividades com elevado envolvimento, que permitam o desenvolvimento de habilidades e competências pessoais e profissionais, ainda no período de formação.</p>

<h1 class="articleSectionTitle">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Active methodologies can be understood as teaching methods that actively involve students during the learning process. Through meaningful actions and activities, students reflect on what they are doing and what they are learning. Alternatively, such approaches can be mentioned in the literature as inductive teaching. These methods are similar because the student assumes greater responsibility and protagonism for their learning, which may be based on research and/or collaborative activities, involving discussion and problem-solving. The teacher is a facilitator of learning, not acting as a primary source of knowledge, evaluating, and observing his students’ progress, and providing the necessary assistance at specific times. As a result of student engagement, there is greater retention and understanding of the content covered, as well as greater attention and concentration on the proposed activities (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Hernández-de-Menéndez et al.; 2019</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>Hernández-de-Menéndez, M., Vallejo Guevara, A., Tudón Martínez, J.

<p>Despite recent and modern, active methodologies were already highlighted by classic authors in Education at the beginning of the 20th century, such as John Dewey and Lev Vygotsky, in the context of school education for children and young people. The first emphasized the importance that the knowledge passed on in the classroom should always be introduced by real situations, which would generate students' interest in learning since education should be considered as a life process and not as a preparation process for a future life (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Williams, 2017</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>Williams, M. K. (2017). John Dewey in the 21st Century. Journal of Inquiry and Action in Education, 9(1), 91-102.</span></span></span>). The second one indicated interactive activities such as productive discussions, constructive feedback, and collaboration with others, as fundamental for the construction of knowledge, with the teacher being the main promoter and motivator of this type of interaction (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Kurt, 2020</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>Kurt, D. S. (2020, July 11). Lev Vygotsky - Sociocultural theory of cognitive development. Educational Technology.

            </a></span></span>). Both characteristics emphasized by these authors are fundamental pillars of active methodologies applied in current times.</p>
<p>Even with the different advantages and good results of using active methodologies, most teachers still prefer traditional methodologies, especially teachers in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Stains et al. 2018</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>Stains, M., Harshman, J., Barker, M.

            </a></span></span>). The main reasons given by teachers are the insufficient time to prepare classes with new methodologies, limited resources, lack of institutional support, difficulty in approaching content and making assessments using such approaches, students' resistance to participating in the proposed active activities, in assuming responsibility for their learning and being forced to carry out group activities (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Deslauriers et al., 2019</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>Deslauriers, L., McCarty, L.

            </a></span></span>).</p>
<p>Despite these facts, universities and professors in their initiatives, have considered the different benefits of active methodologies and have invested in environments and situations conducive to their adoption in higher education curricula (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Hernández-de-Menéndez et al.; 2019</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>Hernández-de-Menéndez, M., Vallejo Guevara, A., Tudón Martínez, J.

            </a></span></span>). The need to train professionals with technical skills combined with problem-solving skills, present in the day-to-day activities of professions, encourages the use of these approaches with university students, in the most different areas. The development of skills and abilities valued by the labor market, such as critical thinking, analysis, problem-solving, leadership, teamwork, and the use of information and communication technologies, among others; are also attractive consequences of the use of active methodologies (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Prince and Felder, 2006</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>Prince, M. J., Felder, R. M. (2006). Inductive teaching and learning methods: Definitions, comparisons, and Research Bases.

            </a></span></span>).</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic, social distancing actions, and the sudden deployment of remote learning have also accelerated the use of active approaches. In this context, professors were challenged to maintain attractive and quality teaching through computer screens, cell phones, and TVs. The use of methods of greater student engagement, together with technological tools, has a high potential for maintaining performance and learning, even in times when face-to-face meetings were not possible (Donitsa-Schimdt and Ramot, 2020; <span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Palmeira et al., 2020</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>Palmeira, R.

<p>Considering this context, the general objective of this work is to verify the temporal evolution, in Brazil and the world, of the use of active methodologies in the context of higher education courses in Engineering, through a systematic mapping of the literature. Specifically, we seek to identify the main researchers involved in research in this area in recent years, and their geographic location, in addition to verifying the Brazilian presence in these researches. Based on a brief analysis of the titles, abstracts, and keywords of the listed works, the aim is to identify which active methodology is most used by professors of higher education courses in Engineering. Thus, the aim is to understand how such methodologies have entered the classrooms of these courses and how teachers and students have received this change in the teaching-learning process.</p>

<li><div>1. Research questions: initially, 4 research questions were defined to be answered in this systematic mapping: <ul list-type="bullet">
<li><p>Is it possible to observe a growth in the use of active methodologies in Engineering courses, based on the publications found by the established research protocol and for the selected period of study?</p></li>
<li><p>Which journals are the main vehicles for disseminating works involving active methodologies in higher education courses in Engineering? Who are the authors and how are they connected in the production of such works?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the geographic distribution of the researchers who published works in this period? Is it possible to establish a profile of the Brazilian presence in this research?</p></li>
<li><p>When evaluating the titles, abstracts, and keywords of the selected works, is it possible to identify the active methodologies most used/reported by researchers?</p></li>
</ul> </div></li>
<li><p>2. Search engines: Web of Science (WoS) and ScienceDirect (SciDir). Such platforms were chosen because they include journals that publish results in the areas of Engineering.</p></li>
<li><p>3. Language: English. The choice of this language considers its majority use in scientific publications and the mandatory use of the listed search engines.</p></li>
<li><p>4. Search string (or descriptors): (“active learning”) AND (“education”) AND (“engineering”). The search terms include English words commonly used in publications that address active methodologies and education in the context of higher education courses in Engineering.</p></li>
<li><p>5. Research period: 2005 to 2020. It is believed that the fifteen-year interval is interesting to investigate established research questions.

<p>This data synthesis sought to find answers to the research questions established for this systematic mapping. Such responses include verifying the advancement of the presence of the theme of active methodologies in higher education courses in Engineering over the last few years; the identification of the main vehicles for disseminating such research and which are the main researchers involved and the identification of the active methodologies preferred by professors in the field of Engineering.</p>
<h1 class="articleSectionTitle">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</h1>
<p>The application of the established research protocol found 433 original research papers, with 55 results obtained from Science Direct (SciDir) and 378 results obtained from Web of Science (WoS). We verified the existence of 17 repetitions, which were found in both search engines, but they were withdrawn and considered only once. Thus, the final number considered was 416 publications, which are indicated in <a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalFigch1"><span class="sci-ico-fileFigure"></span>Appendix A</a> (title and year of publication).</p>
<p>The temporal distribution of publications is presented in <a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalFigf16"><span class="sci-ico-fileFigure"></span>Figure 2</a>, considering the established search period, between 2005 and 2020. This figure differentiates the works found in each search engine, in addition to indicating the accumulated total of publications each year. The years with the highest total number of published works were 2019, with 73 publications (17.5% of the total), 69 from WoS and 4 from SciDir; and 2020, with 71 publications (17.1% of the total), 57 from WoS and 14 from SciDir.</p>

        </p>
<p>It is possible to observe a significant increase in the number of works published from 2015. Until that year, the total number of published works was 153, which is equivalent to 36.8% of the publications found in this mapping. Between 2015 and 2020, 263 scientific articles were published on active methodologies in higher engineering courses, corresponding to 63.2% of the works mapped and 1.72 times the number of works identified between 2005 and 2015.</p>
<p>Such results are indicative of the growth of the presence of active methodologies in the classrooms of higher education courses in Engineering, with an acceleration of their uses and the reports present in the international scientific literature after 2015 and with peaks in the last two years of the period of survey considered (2019 and 2020). The repetition of this research protocol, in a later period, may be interesting to find out how the extension of the Covid-19 pandemic may have affected this growth, considering the context of social isolation and remote teaching.</p>
<p>The works mapped here were published in 124 different scientific journals. <a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalFigf17"><span class="sci-ico-fileFigure"></span>Figure 3</a> highlights the five journals with the highest number of publications in this mapping and the respective number of works published in these journals.</p>

        </p>
<p>The journal that presented the largest number of papers was the International Journal of Engineering Education (IJEE / ISSN: 0949-149X) with 84 articles, which corresponds to 20.1% of the mapped publications. Then, with 34 papers (8.2% of the total), there is the European Journal of Engineering Education (EJEE / ISSN: 0304-3797). Both journals currently publish six editions per year and have in their scopes the dissemination of scientific research focused on the development of education focused on Engineering, on a global and continental level.</p>
<p>The journals IEEE Transactions on Education (IEEE ToE / ISSN: 0018-9359) and Computer Applications in Engineering Education (CAE / ISSN: 1061-3773) were, respectively, the third and fourth journals with more publications in this mapping. IEEE ToE is linked to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and seeks to carry out educational research linked to higher education courses in Electrical, Electronics, and Computer Engineering. This result highlights the presence of this area of Engineering among those that most disseminate their results of active methodologies in the scientific literature. The CAE journal, on the other hand, addresses studies on the use of computers, the Internet, tools, and software, in the context of Engineering education, which also highlights the initiatives of teachers to include new technologies, combined with active methodologies, in the context of student training.</p>
<p><a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalFigf18"><span class="sci-ico-fileFigure"></span>Figure 4</a> shows the five authors most present in the analyzed studies. This survey considered both the position of the main author and co-author of the works. In the 416 works analyzed, 671 researchers were involved, which corresponds to an average of 1.61 researchers involved per work. Maura Borrego (University of Texas at Austin, USA) was the researcher with the largest number of papers, with 6 participations, 4 of which as first author. Shane Brown (Oregon State University, USA) was second, with 5 participations, 2 as lead author. Jeffrey Rhoads (University of Purdue, USA), Noboyuki Ogawa (Gifu National College of Technology, Japan), and José Manuel Lopez-Guede (Universidad del Pais Vasco, Spain) complete the list. An interesting fact common to such researchers is their initial training in Engineering and the carrying out of further studies, seeking to integrate active methodologies into the courses they belong to.</p>

In this way, the most frequent connections are displayed in the figures.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the interaction between these authors is not intense, which indicates the need for more local studies, which report experiences at each university or each course in which they are involved. Even the authors with more publications, shown in <a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalFigf17"><span class="sci-ico-fileFigure"></span>Figure 3</a>, have few collaborations. Maura Borrego and Noboyuk Ogawa have a single frequent collaboration, while José Manuel Lopez-Guede has three frequent connections, all of which are of the same nationality. Shane Brown and Jeffrey Rhoads do not appear in these networks, since their work was always carried out with different professionals, infrequent in the dissemination of results through articles.</p>

<p>Observing all the authors (<a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalFigf22"><span class="sci-ico-fileFigure"></span>Figure 6</a>a), it is possible to assess the predominance of the point cloud over the United States and Europe. Colored circles with a larger diameter indicate the locations with the greatest presence of researchers. Madrid (Spain) with 59 repetitions; West Lafayette (United States) with 39 repetitions; and Barcelona (Spain) with 29 repetitions are the cities with more authors participating in the listed surveys.</p>
<p>The American and European predominance over the other continents is even more evident in <a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalFigf23"><span class="sci-ico-fileFigure"></span>Figure 6</a>b, which restricts the locations that presented at least 10 repetitions. In this condition, it is noted the lack of points in Asia, Oceania, and Africa, in addition to a large reduction in the presence of works from South America. In this last region, the works carried out in Chile and Colombia stand out, which in terms of the same location, presented more papers than Brazil.</p>
<p><a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalFigf24"><span class="sci-ico-fileFigure"></span>Figure 6</a>c shows the location of the first authors. The European and American predominance remains evident, considering that these regions have a research network on the subject and investments in science already consolidated, making them the main international references (<span class="ref"><strong class="xref xrefblue">Reis et al., 2017</strong><span class="refCtt closed"><span>Reis, A.

            </a></span></span>). The presence of researchers leading publications on all continents is an encouraging fact, in the sense that active methodologies are already widespread worldwide and that there is a concern on the part of Engineering professors to bring them to the classroom.</p>
<p><a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalFigf25"><span class="sci-ico-fileFigure"></span>Figure 7</a> shows a clipping of the maps for the South American continent to highlight Brazil. When comparing the map of all authors (<a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalFigf25"><span class="sci-ico-fileFigure"></span>Figure 7</a>a) and the map of first authors (<a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalFigf27"><span class="sci-ico-fileFigure"></span>Figure 7</a>b), there is a lot of similarity, which indicates that Brazilian researchers, in different regions, led research related to active methodologies aimed at Engineering courses. Numerically speaking, 40 researchers participated in such works, and 17 of these have a Brazilian researcher as the first author. Four of the five Brazilian regions had at least one participation in works on active methodologies. Only the Midwest region did not have representatives. The highest concentration of articles was seen in the South and Southeast regions, with papers coming from both capitals and cities in the interior. Despite this optimistic approach, it is believed that Brazil can still evolve in carrying out research and implementing active methodologies in Engineering courses. It is important to point out that the protocol of this research only collected works published internationally and that many researchers may choose to disseminate their research nationally, through journals and events in the country, whose papers were not captured in this survey.</p>

<li><p>• Words with many repetitions that describe elements of scientific works: common words of the language of scientific articles, such as “study” (estudo/trabalho); “research” (pesquisa); “outcomes” (resultados); “results” (resultados, resulta em); “impact” (impactos); “change” (mudanças); “analysis” (análise); “improving” (melhorias).</p></li>
<li><p>Words related to engineering and technology: terms such as “desgin” (projeto); “development” (desenvolvimento); “technology” (tecnologia); “digital” (digital); “simulation” (simulação); “systems” (sistemas); “tools” (ferramentas); which are words commonly present in the vocabulary of engineers and which may be embedded in the disciplines in which the active methodologies were applied.</p></li>
<li><p>Words related to skills and competences developed by students: they may have been used to describe the main results expected and obtained with the implementation of active methodologies. Terms like “skills” (habilidades); “analysis” (capacidade de análise); “management” (capacidade de gerenciamento); “communication” (comunicação); “groups” e “teamwork” (trabalho em grupo); creativity” (criatividade) are the most prominent in this category.</p></li>
<li><p>Words related to active methodologies: “flipped” (inverted, which refers to the flipped classroom); ‘Project-based” and “PBL” (problem and project-based learning); were the most repeated terms regarding active methodologies. Secondarily, the terms “blended” (blended teaching); “peer” (about peer learning)” and “case” (about case studies).

<h1 class="articleSectionTitle">CONCLUSÕES</h1>
<p>The implementation of the proposed research protocol resulted in a list of 416 scientific publications, obtained from the Science Direct and Web of Science platforms. The analysis of this list allowed the verification of the temporal distribution of publications, which allowed observing a strong growth in the dissemination of scientific works linked to active methodologies in the context of higher education courses after 2015. In this period, 63.2% of the works mapped were published, with 2019 and 2020 together representing 34.6% of the total number of publications. It was also noted that 124 journals received the listed publications, with 20.1% of them published by the International Journal of Engineering Education (IJEE / ISSN: 0949-149X).</p>
<p>The mapping of researchers and their location indicated the predominance of research carried out by Americans and Europeans, with emphasis on Spanish researchers. Maura Borrego (University of Texas at Austin, USA), Shane Brown (Oregon State University, USA), Jeffrey Rhoads (University of Purdue, USA), Noboyuki Ogawa (Gifu National College of Technology, Japan), and José Manuel Lopez-Guede (Universidad del Pais Vasco, Spain) were the researchers who most participated in publications in the analyzed period. It was possible to observe research carried out on all continents, which indicates that professors of Engineering courses have been open to the use of active methodologies and that future perspectives can be interesting, in the sense of favoring learning in these courses. Brazil also participates in international research on the subject, with 40 researchers as authors and co-authors of these publications, from four of the five regions of the country. There is a predominance of researchers located in the South and Southeast of the country, being both in capitals and in the interior of the states.</p>
<p>From the evaluation of the terms present in the titles, abstracts, and keywords of the studies listed in this mapping, it was possible to observe that the most present active methodologies were the flipped classroom, problem-based learning, and project-based learning. Such methodologies are easily adaptable to the reality of the contents of Engineering courses and facilitate the integration between theory and practice, which can motivate teachers to seek its implementation, in a moment of transition between traditional teaching and active teaching.</p>
<p>As recommendations for future research, we believe that a short-term evaluation of the use of active methodologies in Engineering courses is important, as a way of identifying the effects of the pandemic and remote teaching on its implementation in the classroom. The identification of the growth of new methodologies, which surpass those identified in this work, can also be a result identified in this repetition. The inclusion of other platforms and other scientific works, not just articles, are also possible modifications in the methodology proposed here and that allow obtaining different insights about active teaching in Engineering. Finally, crossing the results obtained from Engineering courses with other undergraduate courses is a possibility to increase the set of methodologies that can be used with engineers. An analysis of the reality of each area of Engineering is also another interesting aspect of future research.</p>
